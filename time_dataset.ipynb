MILITARY ADVISER WITH A VIETNAMESE DETACHMENT, VENTURED OUT OF HIS COMPOUND NEAR THE COASTAL TOWN OF PHANTHIET, 90 MILES EAST OF SAIGON, ON AN OFF-DUTY HUNTING TRIP. INSTEAD OF GAME, SERGEANT MATAGULAY RAN INTO A BAND OF COMMUNIST VIET CONG GUERRILLAS, WAS HELD CAPTIVE UNTIL HIS RELEASE LAST MONTH . LAST WEEK, IN HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE HE WAS FREED, MATAGULAY DEPICTED THE SPARTAN LIFE AND GRIM DEDICATION OF THE VIET CONG . MATAGULAY SAID THAT THE VIET CONG MOVED FREELY OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THAT IN THE VILLAGES PEASANTS FREELY OFFERED REBELS FOOD AND SHELTER . THE TYPICAL MENU FOR BOTH PRISONER AND CAPTORS WAS RICE, SALT AND FISH OIL . RATS WERE AN OCCASIONAL DELICACY THAT BRIGHTENED THE DIET SERVED BOTH AS RAT SOUP AND BARBECUED RODENT . THOUGH GAME WAS PLENTIFUL, THE REDS NEVER HUNTED . \" THEY WERE AFRAID TO USE UP AMMUNITION HUNTING DEER, \" SAID MATAGULAY . FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF HIS CAPTIVITY, MATAGULAY WAS TIED UP AND CONSTANTLY REMINDED THAT HE WOULD BE KILLED ON THE SPOT IF HE MADE THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT TO ESCAPE . HE UNDERWENT NO PHYSICAL TORTURE, INSTEAD WAS DAILY SUBJECTED TO EIGHT SOLID HOURS OF POLITICAL INDOCTRINATION AND INTERROGATION . MATAGULAY WAS FORCED TO LISTEN TO THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS ON COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM'S RADIO HANOI THREE TIMES A DAY AND WAS REGULARLY TESTED ON WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE WORLD SITUATION . OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE MADAGULAY IS A DARKSKINNED GUAMANIAN, HIS INTERROGATORS HARPED ON THE PLIGHT OF THE NEGROES IN THE U.S . SOUTH . AGAIN AND AGAIN, HE REFUSED TO SIGN ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA DOCUMENTS, BUT FINALLY, WRACKED WITH MALARIA AND WITH HIS WEIGHT DOWN FROM 185 TO 145, HE SIGNED FOUR STATEMENTS, \" WHEN I BELIEVED I WAS AT THE END OF MY PHYSICAL ENDURANCE . \" THE DOCUMENTS, WHICH MATAGULAY LATER HAD TO READ ALOUD SO THAT THE VIET CONG COULD RECORD THEM ON TAPE, BITTERLY ATTACKED SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM AND THE U.S.'S SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT .

H-21 TROOP-CARRYING HELICOPTERS TO CLEAN OUT A COMMUNIST-INFESTED JUNGLE HIDEOUT 175 MILES NORTHEAST OF SAIGON . THE REGION WAS A TANGLED, MENACING BATTLEGROUND, WHOSE NAME, LIKE TENNYSON'S BALACLAVA, DERIVES FROM ITS BLOODY HISTORY IN SOUTH VIET NAM'S UGLY GUERRILLA WAR . AS EACH FLIGHT DIPPED INTO THE TINY LANDING ZONE, AN ESCORT OF TWELVE ROCKETCARRYING UH 1-B ( \" HUEY \" ) CHOPPERS SPRAYED THE SCRUBBY UNDERBRUSH WITH ROCKETS AND MACHINE-GUN FIRE . NOT A SINGLE HOSTILE SHOT WAS RETURNED AS THE TROOPS HIT THE GROUND AND FANNED INTO THE JUNGLE . THE ABSENCE OF ENEMY OPPOSITION IN THE LANDING AREA COULD BE LARGELY TRACED TO VIET CONG FEAR OF THE ROCKET-CARRYING HUEYS . BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL IN SOUTH VIET NAM LAST FALL, DEVASTATING COMMUNIST GROUND FIRE AGAINST THE LUMBERING, DEFENSELESS H-21S THREATENED TO HALT THE GOVERNMENT'S HELICOPTER AIRLIFT CAMPAIGN, WHICH HAD BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE OFFENSIVE TACTIC AGAINST THE RED GUERRILLAS . RELUCTANTLY THE TOP U.S . MILITARY BRASS, WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SKEPTICAL THAT A HELICOPTER COULD EVER BE A DEADLY OFFENSIVE WEAPON, THREW THE NEWLYARRIVED HUEYS INTO COMBAT . THEIR MISSION : TO ESCORT AND PROTECT THE TROOPCARRYING COPTERS . \" THE MOST ESSENTIAL UNIT . \" SO EFFECTIVE HAVE THE HUEYS BEEN IN COUNTERACTING VIET CONG GROUND FIRE THAT SOME H-21 PILOTS HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY OUT MISSIONS RATHER THAN FLY WITHOUT HUEY ESCORTS . SINCE LAST OCTOBER, THE HUEYS HAVE FLOWN 3,600 SORTIES, FIRED 1,800 ROCKETS AND 200,000 ROUNDS OF MACHINEGUN AMMUNITION, AND KILLED COUNTLESS HUNDREDS OF REDS . TWO ENLISTED MEN OF THE COMPANY (WHOSE OFFICIAL MILITARY DESIGNATION IS UTILITY TACTICAL TRANSPORT COMPANY) HAVE BEEN KILLED IN COMBAT, AND 19 OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 113-MAN UNIT HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS . TODAY U.S . MILITARY OFFICIALS ESTIMATE THAT, ALTHOUGH THE VIET CONG HAS DOUBLED ITS ANTIAIRCRAFT EFFORT IN THE PAST YEAR, THE TROOP-CARRYING CHOPPERS ARE SUFFERING 25 PER CENT FEWER HITS THAN BEFORE THE HUEYS ARRIVED ON THE VIET NAM SCENE . \" THE HUEYS, \" SAYS GENERAL PAUL HARKINS, THE CAPABLE BOSS OF THE 14,000 U.S . ADVISERS IN SOUTH VIET NAM, \" ARE THE MOST ESSENTIAL UNIT IN MY COMMAND . \" THE IRONY OF THE HUEYS' SUCCESS IS THAT THEY ARE MAKESHIFT KILLERS, ORIGINALLY DESIGNED AS UTILITY AIRCRAFT AND PERSONNEL CARRIERS . BUT HUEY PILOTS BECAME CONVINCED THAT THEIR SPEEDY, MANEUVERABLE CHOPPERS WOULD BE IDEAL SUPPORT AIRCRAFT IN THE KIND OF GUERRILLA WAR SITUATION THAT SOUTHEAST ASIA PRESENTS . ON THEIR OWN, COMPANY PERSONNEL OUTFITTED THEIR HUEYS WITH 16 HOMEMADE ROCKET MOUNTS AND FOUR MACHINE-GUN BRACKETS, PESTERED DUBIOUS BRASS FOR MONTHS TO LET THEM TRY OUT THEIR IDEAS IN ACTION . THE HUEYS' EFFECTIVENESS IS MAINLY THE RESULT OF THEIR ABILITY TO CHUG RIGHT ALONG IN THE SAME FORMATION WITH THE H-21S . UNLIKE FIXED-WING FIGHTER BOMBERS, WHICH FLY TOO HIGH AND TOO FAST TO PICK OUT SPECIFIC TARGETS AND SOMETIMES DROP NAPALM ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS, THE SLOWCRUISING HUEYS CAN SPOT GROUND FIRE IN THE LANDING ZONE AND MOVE IN TO NEUTRALIZE IT WITH DISCRIMINATING FIRE THAT SPARES NONCOMBATANTS . \" IF WE KILL ONE WOMAN OR A CHILD ON A MISSION AND 90 VIET CONG, \" SAYS ONE HUEY PILOT, \" THEN THAT MISSION IS A FAILURE . \" PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT . AS A PREVIOUSLY UNTRIED COMBAT INNOVATION, THE HUEYS CAN AFFORD TO EXPERIMENT IN HELIBORNE ASSAULT TACTICS, ARE PROVIDING THE ARMY WITH INVALUABLE OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN NEW DOCTRINES OF GUERRILLA WARFARE . \" WE'RE WRITING THE BOOK OF TACTICS OURSELVES, \" SAYS MAJOR IVAN SLAVICH, 35, COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE U.T.T . COMPANY . IN COMBAT, THE HUEYS USUALLY FLY A CIRCULAR \" DAISY CHAIN \" PATTERN SO THAT EACH SHIP IS ALWAYS COVERED BY THE CHOPPER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT . \" OUR MACHINE GUNS HAVE MORE ACTUAL KILLING POWER, \" SAYS SLAVICH . \" BUT OUR ROCKETS SEEM TO HAVE A MUCH GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT ON THE VIET CONG . / THE MAKESHIFT KILLERS WITH THEIR MANEUVERABILITY, THE HUEYS CAN SLIDE BACK AND FORTH JUST A FEW FEET OVER THE SUN-SCORCHED RICE FIELDS, SORTING OUT THEIR TARGETS LIKE COWBOYS CUTTING STEERS FROM A HERD . ON ONE RECENT MISSION, THE DESPERATE REDS TRIED TO LOB HAND GRENADES INTO THE OPEN SIDE DOORS OF THE LOW-CIRCLING CHOPPERS . WHEN TWO HUEYS TRIED TO BOX IN AND CAPTURE A FLEEING RED GUERRILLA, HE SUDDENLY WHEELED AND HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM, A HAND GRENADE IN EACH HAND . A BURST OF GUNFIRE FROM THE CHOPPERS CUT HIM DOWN ; BOTH GRENADES EXPLODED BENEATH HIS BODY . FROM THE DOOR OF A GRASS HUT, A GUERRILLA BLAZED AWAY AT A HOVERING HUEY, MISSED ITS COPILOT BY ONLY A FEW INCHES . THE HUEY'S WINGMAN PLANTED A ROCKET SMACK IN THE DOORWAY OF THE HUT AND BLEW IT TO PIECES . SCARED PRINCESS . THE CHOPPER PILOTS CREDIT SLAVICH FOR THE OUTSTANDING SUCCESS OF THE HUEYS, CALL THEIR OUTFIT \" SLAVICH'S PEOPLE . \" SON OF A RETIRED SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATIC WARD POLITICIAN, SLAVICH SERVED AS A MARINE CORPS ENLISTED MAN AFTER WORLD WAR II, BECAME AN ARMY OFFICER AFTER GRADUATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN 1951 . HE WON A COMBAT INFANTRYMAN'S BADGE IN KOREA, BECAME A PILOT IN 1955, TOOK COMMAND OF THE U.T.T . COMPANY LAST NOVEMBER . SLAVICH RUNS AN EASYGOING OUTFIT AT HIS BASE AT THE EDGE OF SAIGON AIRPORT . LIKE TOURISTS, SOME PILOTS TOTE CAMERAS ON MISSIONS, AND SLAVICH HIMSELF USED TO TAKE HIS GERMAN SHEPHERD, PRINCESS, ALONG ON SORTIES UNTIL THE PUP BECAME SO SHELL-SHY THAT SHE NEARLY JUMPED OUT OF THE CHOPPER WHEN THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED . THE PILOTS HAVE A JARGON OF THEIR OWN . THEY \" ZAP \" THE VIET CONG ON A GOOD DAY, CALL SAIGON \" THE VILLE, \" EXPRESS FERVENT APPROVAL OF EVERYTHING FROM A GIRL TO A CHOPPER WITH THE WORD \" OUTSTANDIN' . \" TOP-RANKING VISITORS OFTEN HITCH RIDES ON THEIR FLIGHTS TO GET IN A FEW PERSONAL LICKS AT THE VIET CONG . BRIGADIER GENERAL JOSEPH STILWELL JR., SON OF \" VINEGAR JOE, \" FREQUENTLY RIDES SHOTGUN IN SLAVICH'S OWN CHOPPER . ONCE, WITH STILWELL ABOARD, SLAVICH HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN A RED-INFESTED AREA . \" I WAS SCARED TO DEATH, \" SAID SLAVICH . GLAD THE VIET CONG DIDN'T COME ALONG, BECAUSE I KNOW DAMN WELL THAT GENERAL STILWELL WOULD HAVE MADE US FIGHT FOR THE MACHINE INSTEAD OF LETTING US RUN . \" / PUCKER UP & PRAY . \" DEADLY AS THE HUEYS ARE, THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS . AS BOTH DOORS MUST BE KEPT WIDE OPEN TO GIVE THE AUTOMATIC RIFLE-TOTING SIDE GUNNERS COMPLETE VISIBILITY, THE BLAST OF THE ROCKETS CREATES AN EAR-SHATTERING DIN IN THE COPTER'S CABIN . EVEN WORSE, THE HUEYS ARE VIRTUALLY UNARMORED, AND ENEMY FLAK CUTS THROUGH THEM EASILY . ALL FOUR CREWMEN NOT ONLY WEAR FLAK VESTS BUT ALSO SIT ON A PILE OF VESTS TO PROTECT PRIVATE PARTS . \" WHEN AN ENEMY IS SHOOTING AT YOU AT THAT LOW ALTITUDE, IT'S THE MOST HOPELESS FEELING IN THE WORLD, \" SAYS ONE PILOT . \" THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT PUCKER UP AND PRAY . \" BUT BECAUSE OF THE HUEYS' PERFORMANCE, THE ARMY IS NOW ENCOURAGING THE DESIGN OF A MUCH BETTER, ARMORED, ATTACK HELICOPTER, WHICH MIGHT ACHIEVE SPEEDS OF 175 KNOTS AND EMPLOY HEAVIER MACHINE GUNS AND PERMANENTLY INSTALLED TURRETS FOR THE LETHAL ROCKETS . FROM MAJOR SLAVICH COMES THE RATIONALE FOR SUCH AN AIRCRAFT . / WE CAN STAY IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS THE HELICOPTERS WE ARE PROTECTING, \" HE SAID . \" WE CAN WORK IN CLOSE, WE CAN WORK IN UNLIMITED VISIBILITY, WE CAN VARY OUR AIRSPEED FROM 100 KNOTS TO ZERO .

THE BROOKE RAJAHS RULED THEIR KENTUCKY-SIZE KINGDOM WITH THE STERN DIGNITY OF A VICTORIAN PATERFAMILIAS, BUT WITH HUMANITY AND IMAGINATION AS WELL ; IN THE ANNALS OF COLONIALISM, FEW DYNASTIES HAVE BEEN SO SELFLESSLY DEVOTED TO THEIR SUBJECTS' WELFARE . THE FIRST BROOKE RAJAH WAS JAMES, A WEALTHY, HIGH-MINDED ADVENTURER WHO SAILED OUT FROM ENGLAND TO \" RID THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO OF BARBARISM . \" IN SARAWAK HE FOUND HIS OPPORTUNITY . FOR THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI, HE SUBDUED A STUBBORN CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE MALAYS AND DYAKS . IN GRATITUDE FOR HIS SERVICES (PLUS $2,000 OF BROOKE'S CASH), THE OPPRESSIVE SULTAN IN 1841 MADE HIM RAJAH OF SARAWAK . INDIFFERENT TO CROCODILES, BOA CONSTRICTORS AND POISONED ARROWS, THE WHITE RAJAH LIVED ONLY FOR HIS HANDSOME, AMIABLE PEOPLE . IN 1848 HE WAS KNIGHTED BY HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY, AND IN 1864 BRITAIN RECOGNIZED HIS RAJ . HE DIED A BACHELOR IN 1868 AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS NEPHEW CHARLES, WHO RULED FOR 50 YEARS . RANEE PAN . THE RAJAH WHO BROUGHT SARAWAK INTO THE MODERN WORLD WAS CHARLES BROOKE'S SON, WHO TOOK OVER IN 1917 . IN THE MORE HUMDRUM WORLD OF THE 20TH CENTURY, WITTY, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED SIR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE BECAME EVEN MORE OF A LEGEND THAN HIS PREDECESSORS . HE ISSUED HIS OWN STAMPS, FLEW HIS OWN FLAG, MAINTAINED HIS OWN ARMY AND POLICE FORCE . HIS RANEE WAS SYLVIA BRETT, THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF A VISCOUNT WHO, IT WAS SAID, HAD BEEN SIR JAMES BARRIE'S INSPIRATION FOR PETER PAN . ANOTHER LITERARY ADMIRER WAS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW . WHEN SYLVIA MARRIED THE RAJAH IN 1911, HE WROTE : RIDE A COCK HORSE TO SARAWAK CROSS TO SEE A YOUNG RANEE CONSUMED WITH REMORSE . SHE'LL HAVE BELLS ON HER FINGERS, AND RINGS THROUGH HER NOSE, AND WON'T BE PERMITTED TO WEAR ANY CLOTHES . THE BROOKES HAD THREE PRETTY DAUGHTERS, WHO GREW UP IN ENGLAND AND WERE KNOWN TO EVERY TABLOID READER AS PRINCESS GOLD, PRINCESS BABA AND PRINCESS PEARL . AT A GLITTERING SOCIETY WEDDING IN 1933, GOLD BECAME LADY INCHCAPE, BUT BABA AND PEARL WERE TOASTED IN EVERY PUB WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED : BABA TO A WRESTLER, PEARL TO A BANDLEADER . STOCKPILING HEADS . THEIR FATHER HAD LITTLE TIME FOR FRIVOLITY . A SHREWD, SELFEFFACING ADMINISTRATOR, SIR CHARLES TRAVELED TO THE FAR CORNERS OF HIS LAND PERSUADING TRIBAL CHIEFS TO END THEIR WARS AND FORSWEAR HEAD-HUNTING . WHEN THEY PROTESTED THAT THEIR ENEMIES' HEADS WERE NEEDED TO PROPITIATE THE GODS, THE RAJAH ORDERED HIS ENGLISH CIVIL SERVANTS TO STOCKPILE MUMMIFIED LEFTOVERS FROM PREVIOUS WARS AND TO LEND THEM OUT TO THE VILLAGERS AS NEEDED . FROM HIS HANDSOME RIVERSIDE FORTRESS IN KUCHING, HE BROUGHT MODEST PROSPERITY TO THE KINGDOM BY EXPLOITING ITS OIL AND RUBBER RESOURCES AS WELL AS DIAMONDS, BIRDS' NESTS (FOR CHINESE GOURMETS) AND GUTTA-PERCHA (FOR GOLF BALLS) . IN 1941, CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BROOKE RAJ, SIR CHARLES GAVE HIS PEOPLE A CONSTITUTION AND SET THEM ON THE ROAD TO SELF-GOVERNMENT . CONTEMPLATING WAR-RAVAGED SARAWAK IN 1946, SIR CHARLES SADLY REALIZED THAT HIS RAJ HAD BECOME AN ANACHRONISM IN THE POSTWAR WORLD . CEDING SARAWAK TO BRITAIN, HE EXPLAINED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD FIND \" NEW HOPE IN AN ERA OF WIDENING ENLIGHTENMENT, STABILITY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS . \" ANOTHER CHANCE . WHEN SIR CHARLES RETIRED TO LONDON, WITH A $2.8 MILLION TRUST FUND THAT WILL ULTIMATELY REVERT TO SARAWAK, THE NATIVES FOUGHT BITTERLY AGAINST BRITISH RULE, EVEN KILLED THE SECOND GOVERNOR, WHO OCCUPIED THE BROOKES' OLD PALACE . THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE LOSS OF ITS LEADER . WHEN THE MALAYSIAN FEDERATION (TIME COVER, APRIL 12) COMES INTO EXISTENCE IN AUGUST, STRIFETORN SARAWAK WILL BE ONE OF ITS STATES AND WILL HAVE ITS BEST OPPORTUNITY YET TO ACHIEVE PROSPERITY AND STABILITY . THE LAST WHITE RAJAH DID NOT LIVE TO SEE THAT DAY . LAST WEEK, AT 88, SIR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE DIED IN HIS LONDON HOME . WHEN THE NEWS REACHED SARAWAK, THE SPIRIT-WORSHIPING DYAKS REJOICED, FOR THEY KNEW THAT HIS SOUL WOULD RETURN TO THE STREAM-LACED LAND OF HIS FATHERS .

AMAHS FROM HAINAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE USUALLY MARRIED . THEIR HUSBANDS USED TO BE ADMIRABLE CRICHTONS OF COLONIAL SOCIETY, AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN TIME USED TO FOLLOW MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS ACROSS THE GLEAMING FLOORS . THOUGH WELL-TRAINED AMAHS NOWADAYS EARN UP TO $70 A MONTH A HIGH WAGE FOR MALAYA THEIR DAUGHTERS MOSTLY PREFER OFFICE AND FACTORY JOBS THAT GIVE THEM GREATER FREEDOM WITH NO OVERTONES OF COLONIALISM . THEIR PLACES ARE BEING TAKEN BY A NEW GENERATION OF FLIBBERTIGIBBETS WHOSE MINDS ARE APT TO BE MORE ON MEN THAN HELPING THE \" MEM . \" MOSTLY MALAYAN OR INDIAN GIRLS, WITH A SPRINKLING OF UNTRAINED CHINESE, THEY ARE PRETTIER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THEIR FOREBEARS AND, SAY THEIR MEMS, OFTEN DOWNRIGHT INSOLENT . FOR THEIR PART, THE MAIDS COMPLAIN BITTERLY THAT THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING MALAYAN MIDDLE CLASS IS EVEN MORE TYRANNICAL THAN THE BOSSIEST BRITONS . IF FLEDGLING AMAHS HAVE A TALENT FOR SMASHING THE WEDGWOOD, THE WIVES OF BRITISH SOLDIERS AND TECHNICIANS, COMING FROM A LAND WHERE SERVANTS HAVE VANISHED FROM ALL BUT THE STATELIEST HOMES, TEND TO BE EVEN CLUMSIER AT HANDLING THE HELP . WAILED ONE SUB-LIEUTENANT'S WIFE WHO RECENTLY HIRED HER FIRST MAID : / I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TREAT HER AS A SERVANT OR A SISTER . \" FRINGE BENEFITS . THE AMAHS' ANSWER IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS CIVIL SERVANTS . IN MALAYA AN ARMY OF 1,000 AMAHS DONNED SUNDAY-BEST SARONGS, CHEONGSAMS AND SARIS, PILED INTO A FLEET OF BUSSES AND DROVE INTO KUALA LUMPUR, THE CAPITAL, WHERE THEY MINCED PRETTILY THROUGH THE WINDING STREETS WAVING PLACARDS INSCRIBED : WE WANT JUSTICE AND WE ARE NOT ANIMALS . THE DEMONSTRATION, WHICH LEFT BLIMPS SNORTING AND OLDSTYLE AMAHS SNEERING, CLIMAXED A COMPLICATED DISPUTE IN WHICH THE AMAHS' UNION IS CHALLENGING A BRITISH WAR OFFICE DECISION TO ABANDON ITS PRACTICE OF HIRING AND FIRING ALL THE AMAHS EMPLOYED BY MILITARY PERSONNEL . SOME 3,000 UNIONIZED AMAHS HAVE ALREADY FORCED THE BRITISH TO BOOST THEIR PAY AND CUT THEIR WORK TIME FROM 70 TO 48 HOURS WEEKLY . BY REMAINING GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THEY HOPE ALSO TO WIN FULL CIVIL SERVICE STATUS, WITH ITS RICH WELFARE BENEFITS . IN ITS ZEAL, THE UNION EVEN CABLED LONDON, \" RESPECTFULLY \" REQUESTING QUEEN ELIZABETH TO INTERVENE IN THE DISPUTE . AFTER UNSUCCESSFUL TALKS WITH THE MILITARY AND BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER SIR GEOFROY TORY, THE AROUSED AMAHS LAST WEEK DIRELY THREATENED A WALKOUT . FOR MANY OF THEIR MEMS, NO HELP AT ALL COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN THE HELPLESS HELP THEY HAD .\n",

THOUGH THE TUNKU HAD DEMANDED THAT SINGAPORE KICK IN 55 PER CENT OF ITS REVENUES TO THE FEDERAL TREASURY, LEE MANAGED TO WHITTLE THE FIGURE DOWN TO 40 PER CENT . BUT OVERPLAYING HIS HAND, HE THEN HELD OUT FOR 39 PER CENT . SO INFURIATED WAS THE TUNKU AT THIS MACY'S V . GIMBELS TACTIC THAT HE DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM TO SINGAPORE TO GET IN THE FEDERATION OR STAY OUT AND REFUSED TO GO TO LONDON FOR THE FINAL BARGAINING SESSIONS . IN LONDON LEE DEMANDED THAT THE BRITISH COMPENSATE SINGAPORE FOR CONTINUED USE OF THE ISLAND'S NAVAL AND MILITARY FACILITIES . BRITAIN CAME THROUGH WITH AN OFFSHORE ISLAND AND AN OFFICERS' CLUB GOLF COURSE, WHICH LEE PROMISED TO TURN INTO A BOTANICAL GARDEN . BUT WHEN THE NEGOTIATIONS TURNED TO SUCH BASIC MATTERS AS SINGAPORE'S CONTINUED STATUS AS A FREE PORT AND ITS FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNDERDEVELOPED BORNEO TERRITORIES, THE DISCUSSIONS BOGGED DOWN .

BRUNEI'S DEFECTION NOT ONLY LEFT THIS WEEK'S JOYOUS CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT A BEAUTY QUEEN BUT IT ALSO TOOK MALAYSIA OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR THE MISS UNIVERSE CONTEST . THE BEAUTY QUEEN FLAP WAS LOW ON THE LIST OF LAST-MINUTE LABOR PAINS ATTENDING THE LONG-AWAITED BIRTH OF MALAYSIA . AT THE INSISTENCE OF INDONESIA'S BELLIGERENT PRESIDENT SUKARNO, WHO BITTERLY OPPOSES THE FEDERATION, MALAYSIA'S INDEPENDENCE HAD BEEN POSTPONED TWO WEEKS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL AUG . 31 STARTING DATE, WHILE A UNITED NATIONS TEAM INVESTIGATED WHETHER OR NOT NORTH BORNEO AND SARAWAK REALLY WANTED TO JOIN .

PHALANXES OF MOTORCYCLE POLICE ESCORTED SHINY OFFICIAL LIMOUSINES TO MEETINGS AT THE MODERNISTIC PAVILION OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD . IN THE PANELED, HIGH-CEILINGED CONFERENCE ROOM AND AT DIPLOMATIC COCKTAIL PARTIES, AN ENDLESS STREAM OF DIGNITARIES STROLLED UP TO GREET THE MAN WHO WAS THE FOCUS OF EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, MALAYA'S STOCKY, SMILING PRIME MINISTER ABDUL RAHMAN, 60, THE GOLF-PLAYING EX-PLAYBOY WHO THIS SUMMER WILL BRING INTO BEING A NEW ASIAN NATION . TO ONE AND ALL, ABDUL RAHMAN HAPPILY TOOK CREDIT FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MALAYSIAN FEDERATION . AS HE PUTS IT, \" I AM THE FATHER OF MALAYSIA . \" STRICTLY SPEAKING, THIS IS NOT TRUE ; THE IDEA HAS LONG BEEN THE DREAM OF ASIAN NATIONALISTS . FOR YEARS, BRITAIN TOO HAS ADVOCATED THE PLAN AS A NEAT WAY TO TIE UP ALL ITS REMAINING ASIAN COLONIES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HONG KONG) INTO ONE TIDY INDEPENDENT PACKAGE . BUT THE TUNKU (IT MEANS PRINCE) WAS THE INDISPENSABLE CATALYST WITHOUT WHOM MALAYSIA COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED . HE WOOED, BULLIED AND CAJOLED THE FOUR OTHER COUNTRIES INTO THE FEDERATION AGREEMENT, WAS THE ONLY LOGICAL CHOICE TO SERVE AS THE NEW NATION'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER . HAPPY, NOT MIGHTY . UNLIKE MOST OTHER NEW ASIAN LEADERS, ABDUL RAHMAN IS NO RABID NATIONALIST . HE HAS REMAINED ON CLOSE, FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE BRITISH, HAS NO INTEREST IN PIE-IN-THE-SKY ECONOMIC SCHEMES . HIS POLITICAL AIMS ARE SIMPLE : \" FOOD INSTEAD OF BULLETS, CLOTHING INSTEAD OF UNIFORMS, HOUSES INSTEAD OF BARRACKS . \" HIS NEW NATION HAS A COMBAT ARMY OF ONLY SEVEN BATTALIONS AND AN AIR FORCE SO SMALL THAT THE PILOTS OFTEN HAVE TROUBLE FINDING A FOURTH FOR BRIDGE . \" MY AMBITION IS NOT A MIGHTY MALAYSIA, \" SAYS ABDUL RAHMAN, \" BUT HAPPY MALAYSIA . \" BUT MANY PRESSING PROBLEMS THREATEN THE TUNKU'S AMBITION . MALAYSIA'S CURRENT PROSPERITY IS ENDANGERED BY ITS DEPENDENCE ON A ONE-CROP ECONOMY . SYNTHETICS HAVE ALREADY CAPTURED HALF THE WORLD'S ANNUAL 5,000,000-TON RUBBER MARKET AND FORCED DOWN THE PRICE OF LATEX . ON TOP OF THIS, BRUNEI'S OIL RESERVES ARE FAST DEPLETING . TO COUNTER THE ECONOMIC THREAT, MALAYA HAS EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUS DIVERSIFICATION PROGRAM, IS OFFERING A FIVEYEAR TAX HOLIDAY TO NEW INDUSTRIES AND PUSHING A BIG LAND-DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR NEW CASH CROPS . POLITICALLY, MALAYSIA HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME ACUTE PAINS . FEARFUL THAT A STABLE NEW NATION WILL CURB COMMUNIST SUBVERSION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, RUSSIA HAS BRANDED THE FEDERATION \" A CUNNING INVENTION OF LONDON \" SET UP WITH THE \" UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT OF U.S . IMPERIALISTS . \" BOTH NEIGHBORING INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN OF INVECTIVE AGAINST THE WHOLE IDEA . WALLS OF PREJUDICE . BY FAR MALAYSIA'S MOST COMPLEX AND FESTERING PROBLEM IS THE SIMMERING RACIAL HOSTILITY BETWEEN THE NEW NATION'S CHINESE AND MALAY POPULATIONS . THROUGHOUT THE FEDERATION, THE ASTUTE, PROSPEROUS, HARD-BARGAINING CHINESE DOMINATE BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND TRADE, HAVE ECONOMICALLY FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE RURAL, EASYGOING MALAYS . CHINESE TYCOONS CONTROL NORTH BORNEO'S BOOMING YOUNG TIMBER INDUSTRY AND SARAWAK'S VAST, ROLLING PEPPER GARDENS ; IN MALAYA, ABDUL RAHMAN'S GOVERNMENT HAS COMPLAINED THAT THE RICH, INBRED CHINESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS ERECTED A \" WALL OF PREJUDICE \" AGAINST AMBITIOUS YOUNG MALAY BUSINESSMEN . THE MALAYS HAVE BUILT SOME WALLS OF THEIR OWN . BY MALAYAN LAW, ONLY ONEQUARTER OF THE GOVERNMENT JOBS CAN GO TO NON-MALAYS, WHILE MALAYS GET SPECIAL CONCESSIONS IN THE GRANTING OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND LICENSES FOR NEW BUSINESSES . RIGID CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SET UP FOR THE CHINESE (MALAYS ARE AUTOMATICALLY CITIZENS), AND THE BORNEO TERRITORIES PLAN IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS TO KEEP CHINESE BUSINESSMEN OUT . \" SPECIAL PRIVILEGES ARE LIKE A GOLF HANDICAP, \" RATIONALIZES MALAYA'S CHINESE FINANCE MINISTER TAN SIEW SIN . \" THEY ARE NOT TO HOLD THE CHINESE DOWN, BUT TO HELP THE MALAYS ALONG . \" GOLF EVERY MORNING . IT IS IRONICALLY FITTING THAT THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS OF FEDERATION ARE THE PROVINCE OF A MAN WHO, ON THE FACE OF IT, IS SO UNCOMPLICATED HIMSELF . \" I AM A LAZY MAN, \" ADMITS ABDUL RAHMAN CHEERFULLY, AND SIX YEARS AS MALAYA'S PRIME MINISTER HAVE NOT ALTERED HIS EASYGOING WAYS . THE TUNKU PLAYS GOLF EVERY MORNING (HANDICAP : 24), CHECKS THE RACING CALENDAR BEFORE MAKING ADVANCE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENTS, ALWAYS TAKES A NAP IN THE AFTERNOON . AN AVID SOCCER FAN AND SPORTS-CAR BUFF, HE IS CHRONICALLY LATE FOR APPOINTMENTS, EXPLAINS : \" BEING PUNCTUAL ALWAYS WEARS ME OUT . \" THE TUNKU HAS THE CHARISMA OF THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL POLITICIAN . HIS TITLE DRAWS ENORMOUS RESPECT FROM THE MASSES, AND AT THE SAME TIME HIS GENUINE CHARM AND EASYGOING MANNER QUICKLY WIN THEIR CONFIDENCE . THOUGH HE IS A DEVOUT MOSLEM, ABDUL RAHMAN ENJOYS BRANDY AND SODA ; HE IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT CURRY COOK . WITH HIS THIRD WIFE, SHARIFAH RODZIAH, AND THEIR FOUR ADOPTED CHILDREN (TWO OF WHOM ARE CHINESE), THE TUNKU LEADS A LIFE OF CHEERFUL DISORDER IN KUALA LUMPUR'S OPEN, AIRY PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE, ALLOWS THE 70 CHILDREN OF HIS SERVANTS THE RUN OF THE HOUSE ; VISITING DIPLOMATS ARE OFTEN SURPRISED DURING A CONFERENCE TO SEE A SERVANT'S CHILD WANDER INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND CLIMB UP ONTO THE TUNKU'S LAP . THE TUNKU HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF PAPER WORK SIMPLY : HE DOES NOT READ IT . HE HAS ALWAYS OF ABSORBING PERTINENT PASSAGES FROM BOOKS OR PAPERS THAT WERE READ ALOUD TO HIM . BUT THOUGH HE HAS NO INTELLECTUAL PRETENSIONS, THE TUNKU COMMANDS UNSWERVING LOYALTY FROM HIS BRILLIANT SUBORDINATES FOR HIS ALMOST CHARMED ABILITY TO AVOID POLITICAL MISTAKES . SAYS AN AIDE : \" HE UNDERSTANDS THE MALAY MIND BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE EVER HAS . \" ABDUL RAHMAN AGREES . \" I HAVE THE FEEL OF THE PEOPLE, \" HE SAYS . \" I HAVE THE TOUCH . \" THE TUNKU'S FIRST WIFE, WHO DIED OF MALARIA IN 1935, WAS THE MOTHER OF HIS TWO CHILDREN, DAUGHTER KATHIJAH, 29, WIFE OF A MALAYAN STUDYING IN BRITAIN, AND SON NERANG, 27, NOW A MAJOR IN THE MALAYAN ARMY . HIS SECOND WIFE WAS A WHITE ENGLISHWOMAN, VIOLET COULSON, WHOM HE MARRIED OVER THE PROTESTS OF HIS FAMILY ; THEY WERE DIVORCED IN 1946 . THE PLAYBOY PRINCE . ABDUL RAHMAN WAS THE SEVENTH SON OF HIS FATHER'S SIXTH WIFE AND, WITH HIS 44 BROTHERS AND SISTERS, LIVED THE PLUSH LIFE BEFITTING THE OFFSPRING OF THE SULTAN OF KEDAH . HIS SIAMESE MOTHER DEMANDED THAT HE BE CARRIED TO SCHOOL ON THE SHOULDERS OF A RETAINER, AND THOUGH HE WAS AN INDIFFERENT STUDENT, HIS ROYAL BIRTH WON HIM A SCHOLARSHIP TO CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HE BEGAN TO READ LAW . BUT THE TUNKU SKIPPED MOST OF HIS LECTURES, SELDOM MISSED A TEA OR DINNERDANCE, DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF MAINLY BY PICKING UP 28 TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS IN HIS SILVER RILEY WITH RED FENDERS . NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, THE PLAYBOY PRINCE FLUNKED HIS BAR EXAMS . SO FAR DOWN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION THAT HE HAD NO CHANCE OF EVER ATTAINING HIS FATHER'S SULTANATE, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO MALAYA AS A MINOR CIVIL SERVANT IN A NUMBER OF REMOTE OUTPOSTS . ON FOOT AND ON ELEPHANT, HE TRAVELED THROUGH THE BUSH GETTING TO KNOW THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE, ONCE EVEN WORKED AS A MANUAL LABORER TO HELP BUILD A NEW MOSQUE, WHICH THE GRATEFUL MALAYS NAMED RAHMANIAH AFTER HIM . WORLD WAR II AND JAPAN'S SWIFT CONQUEST OF THE MALAYAN PENINSULA HASTENED ABDUL RAHMAN'S MATURITY . AS A USEFUL DISTRICT OFFICER, THE TUNKU WAS KEPT ON THE JOB BY THE JAPANESE . SECRETLY, HOWEVER, HE HELPED HIDE ESCAPEES FROM JAPANESE DEATH CAMPS, KEPT IN CONTACT WITH BRITISH GUERRILLA UNITS, WHICH WERE SUPPLYING ARMS TO ANTI-JAPANESE COMMUNIST IRREGULARS IN THE JUNGLES . \" WHO THE HELL IS HE ? \" ABDUL RAHMAN WAS ALSO IN CONTACT WITH THE MALAYAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN TO TAKE ROOT WHEN THE JAPANESE OUSTED THE BRITISH . WITH THE END OF THE WAR, AT THE AGE OF 42, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO ENGLAND TO GET HIS LAW DEGREE, BEGAN TO PLAY A LARGER PART IN THE CAUSE OF MERDEKA (FREEDOM) . HE INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OF EVERY MALAY IN BRITAIN TO JOIN THE NATIONALISTIC MALAY SOCIETY . BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE, YOUNGER MALAY STUDENTS LOOKED TO HIM AS THEIR LEADER, CALLED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS DARKER SKIN \" BLACK UNCLE . \" IN FIERY POLITICAL BULL SESSIONS WITH YOUTHFUL FOLLOWER TUN ABDUL RAZAK, THE SEEDS OF A FUTURE POLITICAL PARTNERSHIP WERE BEING SOWN ; TODAY RAZAK IS THE MOST TRUSTED MEMBER OF HIS CABINET . BACK HOME, THE MIDDLE-AGING LAWYER JOINED THE UNITED MALAY NATIONALIST ORGANIZATION, SLOWLY BEGAN BUILDING UP A POLITICAL FOLLOWING IN HIS NATIVE KEDAH . IN OTHER MALAY STATES, THE TUNKU'S FIREBRAND FOLLOWERS FROM THE LONDON DAYS BEGAN PUSHING HIM FOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP ; FINALLY, IN 1951, ABDUL RAHMAN TOOK OVER AS BOSS OF THE U.M.N.O . \" NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF HIM, \" AN OFFICIAL RECALLS . \" I REMEMBER PEOPLE ASKING \" WHO THE HELL IS HE ? \" ' THEY SOON FOUND OUT . CONVINCED THAT HE COULD ONLY ACHIEVE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AT THE HEAD OF A MULTIRACIAL UNITED FRONT, ABDUL RAHMAN MUTED HOTLY ANTI-CHINESE SENTIMENT IN HIS OWN MALAY PARTY, STUMPED THE COUNTRY URGING CHINESE AND INDIAN LEADERS TO UNITE BEHIND HIM UNDER THE BANNER OF A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ALLIANCE PARTY . TO FINANCE HIS CRUSADE, HE SOLD HIS EXPENSIVE CARS AND MOST OF HIS OTHER PROPERTY . \" I WORKED LIKE MAD, LIVING AND SLEEPING ON TRAINS, \" SAYS THE TUNKU . \" I WAS OFTEN HOME ONLY ONE DAY A MONTH . \" BUT ABDUL RAHMAN'S ZEAL PAID OFF . IN THE 1955 GENERAL ELECTION, THE ALLIANCE SWEPT 51 OF THE 52 SEATS IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE, AND THE TUNKU TOOK OVER AS CHIEF MINISTER UNDER THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER . MERDEKA . ABDUL RAHMAN WAS SO BUSY POLITICKING THAT HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE MILITARY INTEREST IN THE BRUTAL, BLOODY GUERRILLA WAR THAT 350,000 BRITISH AND MALAYAN TROOPS AND HOME GUARDSMEN WERE WAGING AGAINST COMMUNIST INSURGENTS IN MALAYA'S TANGLED JUNGLES . BUT AFTER HIS 1955 ELECTION LANDSLIDE, THE TUNKU GREW AFRAID THAT THE BRITISH MIGHT USE THE EMERGENCY TO DELAY INDEPENDENCE, ARRANGED TO MEET THE COMMUNIST REBEL CHIEFTAINS IN NORTHERN MALAYA TO SEE IF SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT COULD BE WORKED OUT . / MY IDEAS ABOUT COMMUNISM WERE DETERMINED BY THAT MEETING, \" SAYS THE TUNKU . \" I BECAME CONVINCED THAT ONCE A COMMUNIST, ALWAYS A COMMUNIST . THEY COULD NEVER COEXIST WITH US IN AN INDEPENDENT MALAYA . / AS THE WAR IN THE JUNGLE BEGAN TAKING A TURN FOR THE BETTER, ABDUL RAHMAN FLINTILY TOLD BRITAIN THAT THE TIME WAS LONG OVERDUE FOR MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . AFTER MONTHS OF HAGGLING AND DELAY, THE TUNKU FINALLY FORCED BRITAIN'S COLONIAL SECRETARY ALAN LENNOX-BOYD (NOW LORD BOYD) TO THE CONFERENCE TABLE . THROUGHOUT THE GRUELING, THREE-WEEK SESSION IN LONDON, THE TUNKU REFUSED TO BUDGE FROM HIS ULTIMATUM THAT INDEPENDENCE MUST COME NO LATER THAN AUG . 31, 1957 . \" WHEN THE SIAMESE HAVE NO INTENTION OF YIELDING, THEY JUST APPEAR STUPID, \" HE TOLD SUBORDINATES . \" I'M HALF SIAMESE, YOU KNOW . \" AT LAST, LENNOX-BOYD GOT THE POINT AND CAVED IN . ON THE TUNKU'S TARGET DATE, INDEPENDENT MALAYA AT LAST CAME INTO BEING . \" GOOD OLD TUNKU . \" THE TUNKU HAD NO REVOLUTIONARY BLUEPRINT FOR HIS NEW NATION, BROUGHT INTO HIS CABINET HIS OLD LONDON CRONY, ABDUL RAZAK, TO HAMMER OUT A PROGRAM FOR ORDERLY PROGRESS . WHILE ABDUL RAHMAN GROUND DOWN HARD ON RED SUBVERSIVES, MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT RAZAK (IN THE POST HE WILL RETAIN IN MALAYSIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT) STARTED A PROGRAM OF NEW ROADS, SCHOOLS AND CLINICS TO BOOST THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE PRIMITIVE KAMPONGS (VILLAGES), WHERE THE COMMUNISTS WERE TRYING TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD . IN THE AIR-CONDITIONED \" OPERATIONS ROOM \" OF HIS MINISTRY, GADGET-LOVING RAZAK CAREFULLY WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HIS BULLDOZERS ON DOZENS OF CHARTS, MOVIE SCREENS AND MAP DISPLAYS, KEPT HIS PROGRAM CONSTANTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE WITH HIS COLD INSISTENCE ON RESULTS OR ELSE . ABDUL RAHMAN MADE NO EFFORT TO SQUEEZE THE BRITISH OUT OF THE COUNTRY, WAS CONVINCED THAT THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC AND MILITARY PRESENCE OF THE BRITISH WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE INSURANCE FOR MALAYAN STABILITY . TODAY A BRITISH OFFICER COMMANDS THE MALAYAN ARMY, FIVE SENIOR BRITISH CIVIL SERVANTS HOLD KEY POSITIONS IN MALAYAN GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, AND BRITISH BUSINESSMEN CONTROL MORE THAN HALF OF THE RUBBER INDUSTRY, REPATRIATE $86 MILLION IN PROFITS ANNUALLY . \" IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THIS PLACE HAS FLOWERED SINCE INDEPENDENCE, \" SAYS ONE BUSINESSMAN . \" WE'RE REALLY MUCH BETTER OFF . GOOD OLD TUNKU . \" PARLEYS ON THE GREEN . WITH HIS YOUNG NATION BOOMING, ABDUL RAHMAN LOOKED WITH INCREASING FEAR AT THE PREDICAMENT OF NEIGHBORING SINGAPORE, JUST THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE ACROSS THE JOHORE STRAIT . THERE COMMUNISM WAS SPREADING LIKE AN INFECTION AMONG THE UNDERFED, UNDEREMPLOYED MASSES IN SINGAPORE'S SQUALID, TEEMING TENEMENT QUARTERS . BY STRIKES, RIOTS AND BOYCOTTS, THE PEKING-ORIENTED, COMMUNIST-FRONT BARISAN SOCIALIST PARTY TRIED TO TOPPLE THE TOTTERING GOVERNMENT GLUED TOGETHER BY SINGAPORE'S SHIFTY, BRILLIANT, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW, 39 . NEVER TOO CHOOSY ABOUT WHERE HE GOT POLITICAL SUPPORT, \" HARRY \" LEE FIRST TRIED COOPERATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, LATER ADOPTED A \" LEFTIST, NOT EXTREMIST, NONCOMMUNIST, NOT ANTI-COMMUNIST \" POLICY . IT DID NOT WORK ,SAVE HIS POLITICAL NECK, HE WAS FORCED TO GO FOR HELP TO AN OLD GOLFING PARTNER ABDUL RAHMAN . LEE'S VACATION HOUSE BORDERED A FAIRWAY OF KUALA KUMPUR'S RAMBLING SELANGOR GOLF CLUB, WHERE THE TUNKU SHOT HIS DAILY ROUND . FROM TEE TO GREEN, LEE TRIED TO CONVINCE ABDUL RAHMAN THAT SINGAPORE'S RICKETY COALITION COULD NEVER SURVIVE ANOTHER ELECTION, AND THAT A RED SINGAPORE COULD ONLY SPELL TROUBLE FOR MALAYA . GRADUALLY, THE TUNKU CAME TO THE FRIGHTENING CONCLUSION THAT SINGAPORE MIGHT WELL BECOME \" A CHINESE CUBA . \" ONE SOLUTION TO THE \" SINGAPORE PROBLEM \" WAS OBVIOUS : A MERGER, SO THAT MALAYA'S POWERFUL INTERNAL SECURITY POLICE COULD MOVE IN AND HELP SINGAPORE AUTHORITIES HOLD RED SUBVERSION IN CHECK . BUT THE TUNKU SHUDDERED AT THE PROSPECT OF UPSETTING HIS NATION'S MALAY RACIAL PREPONDERANCE BY THE ADDITION OF SINGAPORE'S 1,300,000 CHINESE . / IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE POPULATION, \" HE SAYS, \" I THOUGHT OF THE BORNEO TERRITORIES . / WINING & DINING . SARAWAK, BRUNEI AND NORTH BORNEO, HOWEVER, WERE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE FEDERATION SCHEME . BORNEO LEADERS RESENTED BEING INVITED TO JOIN MERELY AS A POLITICAL AND RACIAL ACCOMMODATION, DESIRED INSTEAD SOME SORT OF INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR OWN . THEN BRITAIN BEGAN PUTTING QUIET PRESSURE ON THE THREE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM THAT UNION IN MALAYSIA OFFERED THEM FAR MORE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER THAN THEY COULD EVER ACHIEVE BY THEMSELVES . BUT IT WAS ABDUL RAHMAN WHO SOLD THE SCHEME . THE TUNKU WINED AND DINED A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF BORNEO DELEGATIONS IN KUALA LUMPUR, WARMED UP BORNEO LEADERS COOL TO THE FEDERATION WITH PROMISES OF FAVORED POLITICAL POSITIONS IN THE NEW NATION . HE SHREWDLY OFFERED THE BORNEO TERRITORIES 70 SEATS IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, AGAINST ONLY 15 FOR FAR MORE POPULOUS SINGAPORE AND 104 FOR MALAYA . HE PROMISED TAX CONCESSIONS AND A $12 MILLION DOLLOP OF MALAYAN AID ANNUALLY TO THE TERRITORIES, AGREED TO KEEP FEDERAL HANDS OFF BRUNEI'S OIL RESERVES . IT WAS THE TUNKU'S FONDEST HOPE THAT THE NEW NATION COME INTO BEING ON AUG . 31, 1963, THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . THEN LAST DECEMBER CAME A BLOW THAT THREATENED TO DESTROY THE TUNKU'S TIMETABLE . IT WAS THE UPRISING IN BRUNEI . \" JUST TOO MUCH . \" DISCONTENT WITH THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI'S CORRUPT, INEFFICIENT AND AUTOCRATIC REGIME HAD LONG BEEN FESTERING IN THE TINY, DELAWARE-SIZED TERRITORY .

AZAHARI, 34, WANTED INSTEAD TO ALIGN BRUNEI, SARAWAK AND NORTH BORNEO INTO A SINGLE INDEPENDENT STATE WITH HIMSELF AS ITS LEADER . WHEN IT FINALLY ERUPTED, THE REVOLT WAS POORLY ORGANIZED AND BADLY LED . FOUR BATTALIONS OF BRITAIN'S TOUGH LITTLE GURKHA TROOPS LANDED ON BRUNEI, INSIDE OF A WEEK SENT THE SHATTERED REMNANTS OF THE 3,000MAN REBEL ARMY SCUTTLING BACK INTO HIDING IN BRUNEI'S STEAMING JUNGLES . BUT THE BRUNEI REVOLT AT LAST GAVE THE PHILIPPINES AND INDONESIA, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AN EXCUSE TO DISPLAY THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE SCHEME . OBLIVIOUS TO MALAYA'S SUCCESS AGAINST RED INFILTRATION, THE PHILIPPINES FEARED THAT LEFTISTS WOULD ULTIMATELY TAKE OVER THE NEW NATION, THUS PUTTING A CUMMUNIST NEIGHBOR RIGHT ON THEIR DOORSTEP . DUSTING OFF AN OLD CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, THE PHILIPPINES MAINTAINED THAT IN 1878 THE SULTAN OF SULU HAD ONLY \" LEASED, \" NOT SOLD, THE TERRITORY TO THE BRITISH . LONDON STIFFLY REJECTED THE FILIPINO CLAIM TO THE REGION . INDONESIA SHOUTED THAT THE TURMOIL SHOWED THE DEEP DISSATISFACTION WITH MALAYSIA IN THE BORNEO TERRITORIES, AND THAT THE FEDERATION WAS ONLY A PLOT TO EXTEND BRITAIN'S COLONIAL INFLUENCE IN ASIA . RABBLE-ROUSING PRESIDENT SUKARNO KNEW THAT A BRITISH-BACKED, ECONOMICALLY VIABLE MALAYSIA WOULD NOT ONLY DERAIL HIS AMBITION TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE BORNEO TERRITORIES, BUT MIGHT ALSO SERVE AS AN INDUCEMENT TO REBELLION FOR THE PEOPLE OF DEPRESSED INDONESIAN BORNEO . MOREOVER, ABDUL RAHMAN HAS IGNORED EVERY \" REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE \" FOR WHICH SUKARNO STANDS, HAS IN THE PROCESS CREATED A CONSERVATIVE, PROSPEROUS NATION, WHILE REVOLUTIONARY, LEFTIST INDONESIA, WITH ITS 100 MILLION PEOPLE, HAS SLID TO THE EDGE OF ECONOMIC RUIN . SAYS A DIPLOMAT :. \" TO HAVE A LITTLE COUNTRY LIKE THIS EXTENDING ITS INFLUENCE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR SUKARNO . \" SOUND GROUND . IN A DRUMFIRE OF PROPAGANDA OUTBURSTS, INDONESIA HAILED THE \" BRUNEI FREEDOM FIGHTERS, \" LASHED OUT AT \" BRITISH MERCENARIES AND PUPPETS, \" GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM TO BRUNEI LEADER AZAHARI, RAVED THAT ABDUL RAHMAN WAS \" ROUND THE BEND . \" (RETORTED THE TUNKU : \" WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A PIG BUT A GRUNT ? / ) DJAKARTA MOBS HANGED THE TUNKU IN EFFIGY, AND SUKARNO DECLARED A \" POLICY OF CONFRONTATION \" AGAINST MALAYA . INDONESIAN JETS BUZZED MALAYAN SHIPS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND ARMY LEADERS DARKLY THREATENED \" INCIDENTS OF PHYSICAL CONFLICT \" ALONG THE BORDER OF BRUNEI AND INDONESIA . SUKARNO DID NOT DARE TO INVADE ; HE PLAINLY HOPED TO INDUCE THE UNITED NATIONS TO STEP IN AND PLACATE HIM AS IT DID WITH WEST NEW GUINEA THUS SPARING HIM THE NECESSITY OF FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE WANTS . HOWEVER, THE U.N . SEEMS UNWILLING TO PLAY SUKARNO'S GAME ; A U.N . OBSERVER TEAM TOLD HIM THAT MALAYSIA IS \" ON SOUND LEGAL GROUND . \" PROMISE TO \" BROTHERS . \" LAST WEEK IN MANILA, THE ACRID DISPUTE BETWEEN INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, AND MALAYSIA ADDED AN UNDERTONE OF TENSION TO THE OTHERWISE CALM MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA . NOT ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA, THE MALAYSIA QUESTION CAME UP REPEATEDLY IN LONG PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ABDUL RAHMAN AND PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT DIOSDADO MACAPAGAL . THE TUNKU WAS ANXIOUS FOR THE WHOLE MATTER TO BE SETTLED QUIETLY . IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE REASONABLE AND FRIENDLY WITH HIS \" MALAY BROTHERS, \" HE AGREED TO LOOK INTO THE FILIPINO CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, LUKEWARMLY ENDORSED A PROPOSAL FOR AN ASIAN SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN HIMSELF, MACAPAGAL, AND INDONESIA'S SUKARNO . BUT THE TUNKU VETOED THE SUGGESTION THAT HE POSTPONE THE CREATION OF MALAYSIA UNTIL SOME SETTLEMENT COULD BE REACHED ; THE FEDERATION, HE SAID, WOULD COME INTO BEING BY AUG . 31 AS PLANNED . FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LANGUAGE, RELIGION, CULTURE OR GEOGRAPHY, MALAYSIA IS NOT A NATURAL NATION . BUT ABDUL RAHMAN HAS FACED PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO MALAYSIA'S IN HIS OWN MALAYA AND THERE A DECENT SOCIETY HAS FLOURISHED . HE DOES NOT PROMISE THE MOON TO HIS NEW NATION, ONLY A SANE, HUMANE, WORKABLE GOVERNMENT . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, MALAYSIA CAN BE, AS JOHN F . KENNEDY HAS SAID, \" THE BEST HOPE OF SECURITY IN THAT VITAL PART OF THE WORLD . /\n",

THOUGH THE TUNKU HAD DEMANDED THAT SINGAPORE KICK IN 55 PER CENT OF ITS REVENUES TO THE FEDERAL TREASURY, LEE MANAGED TO WHITTLE THE FIGURE DOWN TO 40 PER CENT .

THE TUNKU HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF PAPER WORK SIMPLY : HE DOES NOT READ IT . HE HAS ALWAYS OF ABSORBING PERTINENT PASSAGES FROM BOOKS OR PAPERS THAT WERE READ ALOUD TO HIM . BUT THOUGH HE HAS NO INTELLECTUAL PRETENSIONS, THE TUNKU COMMANDS UNSWERVING LOYALTY FROM HIS BRILLIANT SUBORDINATES FOR HIS ALMOST CHARMED ABILITY TO AVOID POLITICAL MISTAKES . SAYS AN AIDE : \" HE UNDERSTANDS THE MALAY MIND BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE EVER HAS . \" ABDUL RAHMAN AGREES . \" I HAVE THE FEEL OF THE PEOPLE, \" HE SAYS . \" I HAVE THE TOUCH . \" THE TUNKU'S FIRST WIFE, WHO DIED OF MALARIA IN 1935, WAS THE MOTHER OF HIS TWO CHILDREN, DAUGHTER KATHIJAH, 29, WIFE OF A MALAYAN STUDYING IN BRITAIN, AND SON NERANG, 27, NOW A MAJOR IN THE MALAYAN ARMY .

ABDUL RAHMAN WAS THE SEVENTH SON OF HIS FATHER'S SIXTH WIFE AND, WITH HIS 44 BROTHERS AND SISTERS, LIVED THE PLUSH LIFE BEFITTING THE OFFSPRING OF THE SULTAN OF KEDAH . HIS SIAMESE MOTHER DEMANDED THAT HE BE CARRIED TO SCHOOL ON THE SHOULDERS OF A RETAINER, AND THOUGH HE WAS AN INDIFFERENT STUDENT, HIS ROYAL BIRTH WON HIM A SCHOLARSHIP TO CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HE BEGAN TO READ LAW . BUT THE TUNKU SKIPPED MOST OF HIS LECTURES, SELDOM MISSED A TEA OR DINNERDANCE, DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF MAINLY BY PICKING UP 28 TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS IN HIS SILVER RILEY WITH RED FENDERS . NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, THE PLAYBOY PRINCE FLUNKED HIS BAR EXAMS . SO FAR DOWN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION THAT HE HAD NO CHANCE OF EVER ATTAINING HIS FATHER'S SULTANATE, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO MALAYA AS A MINOR CIVIL SERVANT IN A NUMBER OF REMOTE OUTPOSTS . ON FOOT AND ON ELEPHANT, HE TRAVELED THROUGH THE BUSH GETTING TO KNOW THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE, ONCE EVEN WORKED AS A MANUAL LABORER TO HELP BUILD A NEW MOSQUE, WHICH THE GRATEFUL MALAYS NAMED RAHMANIAH AFTER HIM . WORLD WAR II AND JAPAN'S SWIFT CONQUEST OF THE MALAYAN PENINSULA HASTENED ABDUL RAHMAN'S MATURITY . AS A USEFUL DISTRICT OFFICER, THE TUNKU WAS KEPT ON THE JOB BY THE JAPANESE . SECRETLY, HOWEVER, HE HELPED HIDE ESCAPEES FROM JAPANESE DEATH CAMPS, KEPT IN CONTACT WITH BRITISH GUERRILLA UNITS, WHICH WERE SUPPLYING ARMS TO ANTI-JAPANESE COMMUNIST IRREGULARS IN THE JUNGLES . \" WHO THE HELL IS HE ? \" ABDUL RAHMAN WAS ALSO IN CONTACT WITH THE MALAYAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN TO TAKE ROOT WHEN THE JAPANESE OUSTED THE BRITISH . WITH THE END OF THE WAR, AT THE AGE OF 42, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO ENGLAND TO GET HIS LAW DEGREE, BEGAN TO PLAY A LARGER PART IN THE CAUSE OF MERDEKA (FREEDOM) . HE INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OF EVERY MALAY IN BRITAIN TO JOIN THE NATIONALISTIC MALAY SOCIETY . BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE, YOUNGER MALAY STUDENTS LOOKED TO HIM AS THEIR LEADER, CALLED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS DARKER SKIN \" BLACK UNCLE . \" IN FIERY POLITICAL BULL SESSIONS WITH YOUTHFUL FOLLOWER TUN ABDUL RAZAK, THE SEEDS OF A FUTURE POLITICAL PARTNERSHIP WERE BEING SOWN ; TODAY RAZAK IS THE MOST TRUSTED MEMBER OF HIS CABINET . BACK HOME, THE MIDDLE-AGING LAWYER JOINED THE UNITED MALAY NATIONALIST ORGANIZATION, SLOWLY BEGAN BUILDING UP A POLITICAL FOLLOWING IN HIS NATIVE KEDAH . IN OTHER MALAY STATES, THE TUNKU'S FIREBRAND FOLLOWERS FROM THE LONDON DAYS BEGAN PUSHING HIM FOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP ; FINALLY, IN 1951, ABDUL RAHMAN TOOK OVER AS BOSS OF THE U.M.N.O . \" NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF HIM, \" AN OFFICIAL RECALLS . \" I REMEMBER PEOPLE ASKING \" WHO THE HELL IS HE ? \" ' THEY SOON FOUND OUT . CONVINCED THAT HE COULD ONLY ACHIEVE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AT THE HEAD OF A MULTIRACIAL UNITED FRONT, ABDUL RAHMAN MUTED HOTLY ANTI-CHINESE SENTIMENT IN HIS OWN MALAY PARTY, STUMPED THE COUNTRY URGING CHINESE AND INDIAN LEADERS TO UNITE BEHIND HIM UNDER THE BANNER OF A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ALLIANCE PARTY . TO FINANCE HIS CRUSADE, HE SOLD HIS EXPENSIVE CARS AND MOST OF HIS OTHER PROPERTY . \" I WORKED LIKE MAD, LIVING AND SLEEPING ON TRAINS, \" SAYS THE TUNKU . \" I WAS OFTEN HOME ONLY ONE DAY A MONTH . \" BUT ABDUL RAHMAN'S ZEAL PAID OFF . IN THE 1955 GENERAL ELECTION, THE ALLIANCE SWEPT 51 OF THE 52 SEATS IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE, AND THE TUNKU TOOK OVER AS CHIEF MINISTER UNDER THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER . MERDEKA . ABDUL RAHMAN WAS SO BUSY POLITICKING THAT HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE MILITARY INTEREST IN THE BRUTAL, BLOODY GUERRILLA WAR THAT 350,000 BRITISH AND MALAYAN TROOPS AND HOME GUARDSMEN WERE WAGING AGAINST COMMUNIST INSURGENTS IN MALAYA'S TANGLED JUNGLES . BUT AFTER HIS 1955 ELECTION LANDSLIDE, THE TUNKU GREW AFRAID THAT THE BRITISH MIGHT USE THE EMERGENCY TO DELAY INDEPENDENCE, ARRANGED TO MEET THE COMMUNIST REBEL CHIEFTAINS IN NORTHERN MALAYA TO SEE IF SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT COULD BE WORKED OUT . / MY IDEAS ABOUT COMMUNISM WERE DETERMINED BY THAT MEETING, \" SAYS THE TUNKU . \" I BECAME CONVINCED THAT ONCE A COMMUNIST, ALWAYS A COMMUNIST . THEY COULD NEVER COEXIST WITH US IN AN INDEPENDENT MALAYA . / AS THE WAR IN THE JUNGLE BEGAN TAKING A TURN FOR THE BETTER, ABDUL RAHMAN FLINTILY TOLD BRITAIN THAT THE TIME WAS LONG OVERDUE FOR MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . AFTER MONTHS OF HAGGLING AND DELAY, THE TUNKU FINALLY FORCED BRITAIN'S COLONIAL SECRETARY ALAN LENNOX-BOYD (NOW LORD BOYD) TO THE CONFERENCE TABLE . THROUGHOUT THE GRUELING, THREE-WEEK SESSION IN LONDON, THE TUNKU REFUSED TO BUDGE FROM HIS ULTIMATUM THAT INDEPENDENCE MUST COME NO LATER THAN AUG . 31, 1957 . \" WHEN THE SIAMESE HAVE NO INTENTION OF YIELDING, THEY JUST APPEAR STUPID, \" HE TOLD SUBORDINATES . \" I'M HALF SIAMESE, YOU KNOW . \" AT LAST, LENNOX-BOYD GOT THE POINT AND CAVED IN . ON THE TUNKU'S TARGET DATE, INDEPENDENT MALAYA AT LAST CAME INTO BEING . \" GOOD OLD TUNKU . \" THE TUNKU HAD NO REVOLUTIONARY BLUEPRINT FOR HIS NEW NATION, BROUGHT INTO HIS CABINET HIS OLD LONDON CRONY, ABDUL RAZAK, TO HAMMER OUT A PROGRAM FOR ORDERLY PROGRESS . WHILE ABDUL RAHMAN GROUND DOWN HARD ON RED SUBVERSIVES, MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT RAZAK (IN THE POST HE WILL RETAIN IN MALAYSIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT) STARTED A PROGRAM OF NEW ROADS, SCHOOLS AND CLINICS TO BOOST THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE PRIMITIVE KAMPONGS (VILLAGES), WHERE THE COMMUNISTS WERE TRYING TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD . IN THE AIR-CONDITIONED \" OPERATIONS ROOM \" OF HIS MINISTRY, GADGET-LOVING RAZAK CAREFULLY WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HIS BULLDOZERS ON DOZENS OF CHARTS, MOVIE SCREENS AND MAP DISPLAYS, KEPT HIS PROGRAM CONSTANTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE WITH HIS COLD INSISTENCE ON RESULTS OR ELSE . ABDUL RAHMAN MADE NO EFFORT TO SQUEEZE THE BRITISH OUT OF THE COUNTRY, WAS CONVINCED THAT THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC AND MILITARY PRESENCE OF THE BRITISH WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE INSURANCE FOR MALAYAN STABILITY . TODAY A BRITISH OFFICER COMMANDS THE MALAYAN ARMY, FIVE SENIOR BRITISH CIVIL SERVANTS HOLD KEY POSITIONS IN MALAYAN GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, AND BRITISH BUSINESSMEN CONTROL MORE THAN HALF OF THE RUBBER INDUSTRY, REPATRIATE $86 MILLION IN PROFITS ANNUALLY . \" IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THIS PLACE HAS FLOWERED SINCE INDEPENDENCE, \" SAYS ONE BUSINESSMAN . \" WE'RE REALLY MUCH BETTER OFF . GOOD OLD TUNKU . \" PARLEYS ON THE GREEN . WITH HIS YOUNG NATION BOOMING, ABDUL RAHMAN LOOKED WITH INCREASING FEAR AT THE PREDICAMENT OF NEIGHBORING SINGAPORE, JUST THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE ACROSS THE JOHORE STRAIT . THERE COMMUNISM WAS SPREADING LIKE AN INFECTION AMONG THE UNDERFED, UNDEREMPLOYED MASSES IN SINGAPORE'S SQUALID, TEEMING TENEMENT QUARTERS . BY STRIKES, RIOTS AND BOYCOTTS, THE PEKING-ORIENTED, COMMUNIST-FRONT BARISAN SOCIALIST PARTY TRIED TO TOPPLE THE TOTTERING GOVERNMENT GLUED TOGETHER BY SINGAPORE'S SHIFTY, BRILLIANT, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW, 39 . NEVER TOO CHOOSY ABOUT WHERE HE GOT POLITICAL SUPPORT, \" HARRY \" LEE FIRST TRIED COOPERATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, LATER ADOPTED A \" LEFTIST, NOT EXTREMIST, NONCOMMUNIST, NOT ANTI-COMMUNIST \" POLICY . IT DID NOT WORK ,SAVE HIS POLITICAL NECK, HE WAS FORCED TO GO FOR HELP TO AN OLD GOLFING PARTNER ABDUL RAHMAN . LEE'S VACATION HOUSE BORDERED A FAIRWAY OF KUALA KUMPUR'S RAMBLING SELANGOR GOLF CLUB, WHERE THE TUNKU SHOT HIS DAILY ROUND . FROM TEE TO GREEN, LEE TRIED TO CONVINCE ABDUL RAHMAN THAT SINGAPORE'S RICKETY COALITION COULD NEVER SURVIVE ANOTHER ELECTION, AND THAT A RED SINGAPORE COULD ONLY SPELL TROUBLE FOR MALAYA . GRADUALLY, THE TUNKU CAME TO THE FRIGHTENING CONCLUSION THAT SINGAPORE MIGHT WELL BECOME \" A CHINESE CUBA . \" ONE SOLUTION TO THE \" SINGAPORE PROBLEM \" WAS OBVIOUS : A MERGER, SO THAT MALAYA'S POWERFUL INTERNAL SECURITY POLICE COULD MOVE IN AND HELP SINGAPORE AUTHORITIES HOLD RED SUBVERSION IN CHECK . BUT THE TUNKU SHUDDERED AT THE PROSPECT OF UPSETTING HIS NATION'S MALAY RACIAL PREPONDERANCE BY THE ADDITION OF SINGAPORE'S 1,300,000 CHINESE . / IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE POPULATION, \" HE SAYS, \" I THOUGHT OF THE BORNEO TERRITORIES . / WINING & DINING . SARAWAK, BRUNEI AND NORTH BORNEO, HOWEVER, WERE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE FEDERATION SCHEME . BORNEO LEADERS RESENTED BEING INVITED TO JOIN MERELY AS A POLITICAL AND RACIAL ACCOMMODATION, DESIRED INSTEAD SOME SORT OF INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR OWN . THEN BRITAIN BEGAN PUTTING QUIET PRESSURE ON THE THREE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM THAT UNION IN MALAYSIA OFFERED THEM FAR MORE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER THAN THEY COULD EVER ACHIEVE BY THEMSELVES . BUT IT WAS ABDUL RAHMAN WHO SOLD THE SCHEME . THE TUNKU WINED AND DINED A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF BORNEO DELEGATIONS IN KUALA LUMPUR, WARMED UP BORNEO LEADERS COOL TO THE FEDERATION WITH PROMISES OF FAVORED POLITICAL POSITIONS IN THE NEW NATION . HE SHREWDLY OFFERED THE BORNEO TERRITORIES 70 SEATS IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, AGAINST ONLY 15 FOR FAR MORE POPULOUS SINGAPORE AND 104 FOR MALAYA . HE PROMISED TAX CONCESSIONS AND A $12 MILLION DOLLOP OF MALAYAN AID ANNUALLY TO THE TERRITORIES, AGREED TO KEEP FEDERAL HANDS OFF BRUNEI'S OIL RESERVES . IT WAS THE TUNKU'S FONDEST HOPE THAT THE NEW NATION COME INTO BEING ON AUG . 31, 1963, THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . THEN LAST DECEMBER CAME A BLOW THAT THREATENED TO DESTROY THE TUNKU'S TIMETABLE . IT WAS THE UPRISING IN BRUNEI . \" JUST TOO MUCH . \" DISCONTENT WITH THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI'S CORRUPT, INEFFICIENT AND AUTOCRATIC REGIME HAD LONG BEEN FESTERING IN THE TINY, DELAWARE-SIZED TERRITORY . LAST YEAR THE SULTAN'S GOVERNMENT SPENT ONLY $50,000 ON DRUGS AND MEDICINE FOR ITS PEOPLE, WHILE LAYING OUT $47,000 FOR ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATION ON THE SULTAN'S BIRTHDAY ACTION ON REQUESTS TO THE GOVERNMENT USUALLY TOOK FROM SIX MONTHS TO THREE YEARS . THE DOMINANT BUT POWERLESS PEOPLE'S PARTY WAS ALSO DEAD-SET AGAINST MALAYSIA ; THE PARTY'S ERRATIC, GOATEED ONETIME VETERINARIAN LEADER, SHEIK A . M . AZAHARI, 34, WANTED INSTEAD TO ALIGN BRUNEI, SARAWAK AND NORTH BORNEO INTO A SINGLE INDEPENDENT STATE WITH HIMSELF AS ITS LEADER . WHEN IT FINALLY ERUPTED, THE REVOLT WAS POORLY ORGANIZED AND BADLY LED . FOUR BATTALIONS OF BRITAIN'S TOUGH LITTLE GURKHA TROOPS LANDED ON BRUNEI, INSIDE OF A WEEK SENT THE SHATTERED REMNANTS OF THE 3,000MAN REBEL ARMY SCUTTLING BACK INTO HIDING IN BRUNEI'S STEAMING JUNGLES . BUT THE BRUNEI REVOLT AT LAST GAVE THE PHILIPPINES AND INDONESIA, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AN EXCUSE TO DISPLAY THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE SCHEME . OBLIVIOUS TO MALAYA'S SUCCESS AGAINST RED INFILTRATION, THE PHILIPPINES FEARED THAT LEFTISTS WOULD ULTIMATELY TAKE OVER THE NEW NATION, THUS PUTTING A CUMMUNIST NEIGHBOR RIGHT ON THEIR DOORSTEP . DUSTING OFF AN OLD CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, THE PHILIPPINES MAINTAINED THAT IN 1878 THE SULTAN OF SULU HAD ONLY \" LEASED, \" NOT SOLD, THE TERRITORY TO THE BRITISH . LONDON STIFFLY REJECTED THE FILIPINO CLAIM TO THE REGION . INDONESIA SHOUTED THAT THE TURMOIL SHOWED THE DEEP DISSATISFACTION WITH MALAYSIA IN THE BORNEO TERRITORIES, AND THAT THE FEDERATION WAS ONLY A PLOT TO EXTEND BRITAIN'S COLONIAL INFLUENCE IN ASIA . RABBLE-ROUSING PRESIDENT SUKARNO KNEW THAT A BRITISH-BACKED, ECONOMICALLY VIABLE MALAYSIA WOULD NOT ONLY DERAIL HIS AMBITION TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE BORNEO TERRITORIES, BUT MIGHT ALSO SERVE AS AN INDUCEMENT TO REBELLION FOR THE PEOPLE OF DEPRESSED INDONESIAN BORNEO . MOREOVER, ABDUL RAHMAN HAS IGNORED EVERY \" REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE \" FOR WHICH SUKARNO STANDS, HAS IN THE PROCESS CREATED A CONSERVATIVE, PROSPEROUS NATION, WHILE REVOLUTIONARY, LEFTIST INDONESIA, WITH ITS 100 MILLION PEOPLE, HAS SLID TO THE EDGE OF ECONOMIC RUIN . SAYS A DIPLOMAT :. \" TO HAVE A LITTLE COUNTRY LIKE THIS EXTENDING ITS INFLUENCE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR SUKARNO . \" SOUND GROUND . IN A DRUMFIRE OF PROPAGANDA OUTBURSTS, INDONESIA HAILED THE \" BRUNEI FREEDOM FIGHTERS, \" LASHED OUT AT \" BRITISH MERCENARIES AND PUPPETS, \" GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM TO BRUNEI LEADER AZAHARI, RAVED THAT ABDUL RAHMAN WAS \" ROUND THE BEND . \" (RETORTED THE TUNKU : \" WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A PIG BUT A GRUNT ? / ) DJAKARTA MOBS HANGED THE TUNKU IN EFFIGY, AND SUKARNO DECLARED A \" POLICY OF CONFRONTATION \" AGAINST MALAYA . INDONESIAN JETS BUZZED MALAYAN SHIPS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND ARMY LEADERS DARKLY THREATENED \" INCIDENTS OF PHYSICAL CONFLICT \" ALONG THE BORDER OF BRUNEI AND INDONESIA . SUKARNO DID NOT DARE TO INVADE ; HE PLAINLY HOPED TO INDUCE THE UNITED NATIONS TO STEP IN AND PLACATE HIM AS IT DID WITH WEST NEW GUINEA THUS SPARING HIM THE NECESSITY OF FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE WANTS . HOWEVER, THE U.N . SEEMS UNWILLING TO PLAY SUKARNO'S GAME ; A U.N . OBSERVER TEAM TOLD HIM THAT MALAYSIA IS \" ON SOUND LEGAL GROUND . \" PROMISE TO \" BROTHERS . \" LAST WEEK IN MANILA, THE ACRID DISPUTE BETWEEN INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, AND MALAYSIA ADDED AN UNDERTONE OF TENSION TO THE OTHERWISE CALM MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA . NOT ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA, THE MALAYSIA QUESTION CAME UP REPEATEDLY IN LONG PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ABDUL RAHMAN AND PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT DIOSDADO MACAPAGAL . THE TUNKU WAS ANXIOUS FOR THE WHOLE MATTER TO BE SETTLED QUIETLY . IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE REASONABLE AND FRIENDLY WITH HIS \" MALAY BROTHERS, \" HE AGREED TO LOOK INTO THE FILIPINO CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, LUKEWARMLY ENDORSED A PROPOSAL FOR AN ASIAN SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN HIMSELF, MACAPAGAL, AND INDONESIA'S SUKARNO . BUT THE TUNKU VETOED THE SUGGESTION THAT HE POSTPONE THE CREATION OF MALAYSIA UNTIL SOME SETTLEMENT COULD BE REACHED ; THE FEDERATION, HE SAID, WOULD COME INTO BEING BY AUG . 31 AS PLANNED . FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LANGUAGE, RELIGION, CULTURE OR GEOGRAPHY, MALAYSIA IS NOT A NATURAL NATION . BUT ABDUL RAHMAN HAS FACED PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO MALAYSIA'S IN HIS OWN MALAYA AND THERE A DECENT SOCIETY HAS FLOURISHED . HE DOES NOT PROMISE THE MOON TO HIS NEW NATION, ONLY A SANE, HUMANE, WORKABLE GOVERNMENT . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, MALAYSIA CAN BE, AS JOHN F .

WHILE THE AMAH (LITERALLY, \" LITTLE MOTHER / ) COOKED, CLEANED AND LOOKED AFTER THE CHILDREN, THE COLONEL'S LADY OR PLANTER'S WIFE SPENT HER MORNINGS AT TENNIS, HER AFTERNOONS AT BRIDGE, AND APPEARED FRESHLY STARCHED ON THE VERANDA AT SUNDOWN TO GREET HER RETURNING HUSBAND WITH COLD STINGERS, HOT CURRY AND ETERNAL COMPLAINT ABOUT THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE IN THE TROPICS . IN MALAYA AND SINGAPORE TODAY, A MEM-SAHIB IS MORE APT TO SPEND HER DAY SCREAMING AT THE AMAH, DOING THE HOUSEWORK HERSELF, OR ELSE TRYING TO POACH THE PERFECT GEM WHO WORKS FOR THE ARBUTHNOTS .

MOST NEW NATIONS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE ALREADY WITH CHINESE MINORITIES AND ARE DEAD-SET AGAINST BRINGING IN MORE REFUGEES FROM THE MAINLAND . HASTENING THEIR EXTINCTION IS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE FINER AMAHS ARE CANTONESE WOMEN WHO TRADITIONALLY BELONG TO KONGSIS, OR SISTERHOODS, THAT PLEDGE THEM TO SPINSTERHOOD . AMAHS FROM HAINAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE USUALLY MARRIED . THEIR HUSBANDS USED TO BE ADMIRABLE CRICHTONS OF COLONIAL SOCIETY, AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN TIME USED TO FOLLOW MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS ACROSS THE GLEAMING FLOORS . THOUGH WELL-TRAINED AMAHS NOWADAYS EARN UP TO $70 A MONTH A HIGH WAGE FOR MALAYA THEIR DAUGHTERS MOSTLY PREFER OFFICE AND FACTORY JOBS THAT GIVE THEM GREATER FREEDOM WITH NO OVERTONES OF COLONIALISM . THEIR PLACES ARE BEING TAKEN BY A NEW GENERATION OF FLIBBERTIGIBBETS WHOSE MINDS ARE APT TO BE MORE ON MEN THAN HELPING THE \" MEM . \" MOSTLY MALAYAN OR INDIAN GIRLS, WITH A SPRINKLING OF UNTRAINED CHINESE, THEY ARE PRETTIER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THEIR FOREBEARS AND, SAY THEIR MEMS, OFTEN DOWNRIGHT INSOLENT . FOR THEIR PART, THE MAIDS COMPLAIN BITTERLY THAT THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING MALAYAN MIDDLE CLASS IS EVEN MORE TYRANNICAL THAN THE BOSSIEST BRITONS . IF FLEDGLING AMAHS HAVE A TALENT FOR SMASHING THE WEDGWOOD, THE WIVES OF BRITISH SOLDIERS AND TECHNICIANS, COMING FROM A LAND WHERE SERVANTS HAVE VANISHED FROM ALL BUT THE STATELIEST HOMES, TEND TO BE EVEN CLUMSIER AT HANDLING THE HELP . WAILED ONE SUB-LIEUTENANT'S WIFE WHO RECENTLY HIRED HER FIRST MAID : / I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TREAT HER AS A SERVANT OR A SISTER . \" FRINGE BENEFITS . THE AMAHS' ANSWER IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS CIVIL SERVANTS . IN MALAYA AN ARMY OF 1,000 AMAHS DONNED SUNDAY-BEST SARONGS, CHEONGSAMS AND SARIS, PILED INTO A FLEET OF BUSSES AND DROVE INTO KUALA LUMPUR, THE CAPITAL, WHERE THEY MINCED PRETTILY THROUGH THE WINDING STREETS WAVING PLACARDS INSCRIBED : WE WANT JUSTICE AND WE ARE NOT ANIMALS . THE DEMONSTRATION, WHICH LEFT BLIMPS SNORTING AND OLDSTYLE AMAHS SNEERING, CLIMAXED A COMPLICATED DISPUTE IN WHICH THE AMAHS' UNION IS CHALLENGING A BRITISH WAR OFFICE DECISION TO ABANDON ITS PRACTICE OF HIRING AND FIRING ALL THE AMAHS EMPLOYED BY MILITARY PERSONNEL . SOME 3,000 UNIONIZED AMAHS HAVE ALREADY FORCED THE BRITISH TO BOOST THEIR PAY AND CUT THEIR WORK TIME FROM 70 TO 48 HOURS WEEKLY .

THE BROOKE RAJAHS RULED THEIR KENTUCKY-SIZE KINGDOM WITH THE STERN DIGNITY OF A VICTORIAN PATERFAMILIAS, BUT WITH HUMANITY AND IMAGINATION AS WELL ; IN THE ANNALS OF COLONIALISM, FEW DYNASTIES HAVE BEEN SO SELFLESSLY DEVOTED TO THEIR SUBJECTS' WELFARE . THE FIRST BROOKE RAJAH WAS JAMES, A WEALTHY, HIGH-MINDED ADVENTURER WHO SAILED OUT FROM ENGLAND TO \" RID THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO OF BARBARISM . \" IN SARAWAK HE FOUND HIS OPPORTUNITY . FOR THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI, HE SUBDUED A STUBBORN CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE MALAYS AND DYAKS . IN GRATITUDE FOR HIS SERVICES (PLUS $2,000 OF BROOKE'S CASH), THE OPPRESSIVE SULTAN IN 1841 MADE HIM RAJAH OF SARAWAK . INDIFFERENT TO CROCODILES, BOA CONSTRICTORS AND POISONED ARROWS, THE WHITE RAJAH LIVED ONLY FOR HIS HANDSOME, AMIABLE PEOPLE . IN 1848 HE WAS KNIGHTED BY HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY, AND IN 1864 BRITAIN RECOGNIZED HIS RAJ . HE DIED A BACHELOR IN 1868 AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS NEPHEW CHARLES, WHO RULED FOR 50 YEARS . RANEE PAN . THE RAJAH WHO BROUGHT SARAWAK INTO THE MODERN WORLD WAS CHARLES BROOKE'S SON, WHO TOOK OVER IN 1917 . IN THE MORE HUMDRUM WORLD OF THE 20TH CENTURY, WITTY, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED SIR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE BECAME EVEN MORE OF A LEGEND THAN HIS PREDECESSORS . HE ISSUED HIS OWN STAMPS, FLEW HIS OWN FLAG, MAINTAINED HIS OWN ARMY AND POLICE FORCE . HIS RANEE WAS SYLVIA BRETT, THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF A VISCOUNT WHO, IT WAS SAID, HAD BEEN SIR JAMES BARRIE'S INSPIRATION FOR PETER PAN . ANOTHER LITERARY ADMIRER WAS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW . WHEN SYLVIA MARRIED THE RAJAH IN 1911, HE WROTE : RIDE A COCK HORSE TO SARAWAK CROSS TO SEE A YOUNG RANEE CONSUMED WITH REMORSE . SHE'LL HAVE BELLS ON HER FINGERS, AND RINGS THROUGH HER NOSE, AND WON'T BE PERMITTED TO WEAR ANY CLOTHES . THE BROOKES HAD THREE PRETTY DAUGHTERS, WHO GREW UP IN ENGLAND AND WERE KNOWN TO EVERY TABLOID READER AS PRINCESS GOLD, PRINCESS BABA AND PRINCESS PEARL . AT A GLITTERING SOCIETY WEDDING IN 1933, GOLD BECAME LADY INCHCAPE, BUT BABA AND PEARL WERE TOASTED IN EVERY PUB WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED : BABA TO A WRESTLER, PEARL TO A BANDLEADER . STOCKPILING HEADS . THEIR FATHER HAD LITTLE TIME FOR FRIVOLITY . A SHREWD, SELFEFFACING ADMINISTRATOR, SIR CHARLES TRAVELED TO THE FAR CORNERS OF HIS LAND PERSUADING TRIBAL CHIEFS TO END THEIR WARS AND FORSWEAR HEAD-HUNTING . WHEN THEY PROTESTED THAT THEIR ENEMIES' HEADS WERE NEEDED TO PROPITIATE THE GODS, THE RAJAH ORDERED HIS ENGLISH CIVIL SERVANTS TO STOCKPILE MUMMIFIED LEFTOVERS FROM PREVIOUS WARS AND TO LEND THEM OUT TO THE VILLAGERS AS NEEDED . FROM HIS HANDSOME RIVERSIDE FORTRESS IN KUCHING, HE BROUGHT MODEST PROSPERITY TO THE KINGDOM BY EXPLOITING ITS OIL AND RUBBER RESOURCES AS WELL AS DIAMONDS, BIRDS' NESTS (FOR CHINESE GOURMETS) AND GUTTA-PERCHA (FOR GOLF BALLS) . IN 1941, CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BROOKE RAJ, SIR CHARLES GAVE HIS PEOPLE A CONSTITUTION AND SET THEM ON THE ROAD TO SELF-GOVERNMENT . CONTEMPLATING WAR-RAVAGED SARAWAK IN 1946, SIR CHARLES SADLY REALIZED THAT HIS RAJ HAD BECOME AN ANACHRONISM IN THE POSTWAR WORLD . CEDING SARAWAK TO BRITAIN, HE EXPLAINED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD FIND \" NEW HOPE IN AN ERA OF WIDENING ENLIGHTENMENT, STABILITY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS . \" ANOTHER CHANCE . WHEN SIR CHARLES RETIRED TO LONDON, WITH A $2.8 MILLION TRUST FUND THAT WILL ULTIMATELY REVERT TO SARAWAK, THE NATIVES FOUGHT BITTERLY AGAINST BRITISH RULE, EVEN KILLED THE SECOND GOVERNOR, WHO OCCUPIED THE BROOKES' OLD PALACE . THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE LOSS OF ITS LEADER . WHEN THE MALAYSIAN FEDERATION (TIME COVER, APRIL 12) COMES INTO EXISTENCE IN AUGUST, STRIFETORN SARAWAK WILL BE ONE OF ITS STATES AND WILL HAVE ITS BEST OPPORTUNITY YET TO ACHIEVE PROSPERITY AND STABILITY . THE LAST WHITE RAJAH DID NOT LIVE TO SEE THAT DAY . LAST WEEK, AT 88, SIR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE DIED IN HIS LONDON HOME .

THREATENING TO DECLARE SINGAPORE AN INDEPENDENT STATE, LEE PRESSURED ABDUL RAHMAN INTO HOLDING FIRM FOR THE FEDERATION'S SEPT . 16 DEADLINE . LAST WEEK THE FINAL OBSTACLE TO INDEPENDENCE WAS CLEARED AWAY WHEN THE U.N.'S MALAYSIA TEAM REPORTED THAT BOTH NORTH BORNEO AND SARAWAK FAVORED THE FEDERATION .

IT WAS NOT UNTIL MOMENTS LATER THAT THEY SPOTTED HIM, A CHUNKY MAN IN A NONDESCRIPT BUSINESS SUIT, PATIENTLY EXAMINING THE MODERNISTIC INTERIOR OF THE DULLES TERMINAL BUILDING . THE COMMITTEE'S MISTAKE, AND THE GENERAL'S DEMEANOR, WERE BOTH SIGNIFICANT . THOUGH THE ELDEST SON OF CHIANG KAI-SHEK, NATIONALIST CHINA'S VENERABLE PRESIDENT, CHIANG CHING-KUO, 53, IS THE MYSTERY MAN OF FORMOSA WHO AVOIDS THE LIMELIGHT . PARTLY, THE MYSTERY HAS PROFESSIONAL REASONS : AS CHIEF OF FORMOSA'S SECRET POLICE AND HEAD OF THE GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES DIRECTED AGAINST RED CHINA, HE NATURALLY SEEKS THE SHADOWS . FORMOSAN BESTSELLER . THE VISIT TO THE U.S., HIS FIRST IN TEN YEARS, IS SAID TO BE WITHOUT SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE . HE CONFERRED WITH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AT BOTH THE CIA AND THE PENTAGON, DISCUSSED THE LATEST ESTIMATES OF CONDITIONS ON THE RED CHINESE MAINLAND . BETWEEN CONFERENCES, HE SQUEEZED IN A ONE-DAY JET FLIGHT TO CAPE CANAVERAL . HE ALSO HAD A 75-MINUTE CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND PRESENTED HIM WITH A COPY OF PROFILES IN COURAGE IN A CHINESE TRANSLATION, ADDING THAT IT WAS A BESTSELLER ON FORMOSA . KENNEDY AND TOP U.S . OFFICIALS WERE SEEING FACE TO FACE THE MAN WHO MAY WELL SUCCEED HIS FATHER AS PRESIDENT OF NATIONALIST CHINA . ON FORMOSA, CHINGKUO IS KNOWN AS \" LITTLE CHIANG, \" AND HIS ONLY MAJOR RIVAL FOR THE TOP JOB IS VICE PRESIDENT CHEN CHENG, WHO SUFFERS FROM A LIVER AILMENT AND HAS BEEN IN SEMIRETIREMENT SINCE JUNE . BORN IN CHEKIANG PROVINCE TO THE GIMO'S FIRST WIFE, A PEASANT GIRL WHO WAS LATER KILLED IN A JAPANESE BOMBING RAID, CHING-KUO WAS 16 WHEN THE GIMO SENT HIM TO MOSCOW IN 1925 \" TO LEARN MORE ABOUT REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS . \" HE JOINED THE KOMSOMOL AND STUDIED GUERRILLA TACTICS AT A RED ARMY ACADEMY . WHEN CHIANG KAI-SHEK BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN 1927, A LETTER OVER CHING-KUO'S NAME APPEARED IN PRAVDA DENOUNCING HIS FATHER AS A \" TRAITOR . \" HE SAYS THE LETTER WAS A FORGERY . CHING-KUO HIMSELF BROKE WITH STALIN ON THE ISSUE OF TROTSKYISM AND PUT IN SOME YEARS OF HARD WORK IN GOLD MINES AND FACTORIES . WHEN THE JAPANESE THREAT FORGED A NEW BOND BETWEEN STALIN AND THE GIMO IN 1937, CHING-KUO WAS PERMITTED TO LEAVE FOR CHINA WITH HIS SHY, APPEALING RUSSIAN WIFE FANINA AND THEIR SON ALAN . SPOT & MOP . OVERJOYED AT HIS SON'S RETURN, THE GIMO NEVERTHELESS THOUGHT HIM TOO RUSSIAN IN HIS OUTLOOK AND HAD HIM TUTORED FOR TWO YEARS TO \" MAKE HIM CHINESE AGAIN . \" EVER SINCE, CHING-KUO HAS LOYALLY AND EFFICIENTLY HANDLED A SUCCESSION OF JOBS FOR HIS FATHER, RANGING FROM OPERATING A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR COMMUNIST SUSPECTS ON GREEN ISLAND TO CREATING A SYSTEM OF POLITICAL COMMISSARS TO CHECK ON LOYALTY IN THE ARMY . UNDER CHING-KUO, NATIONALIST GUERRILLAS PROBE THE MAINLAND FOR SOFT SPOTS IN THE DEFENSES AND PUBLIC DISAFFECTION WITH THE RED REGIME . OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, SOME 1,500 MEN HAVE BEEN PUT ASHORE IN CHEKIANG AND KWANGTUNG PROVINCES . IN U.S . OPINION, INDIVIDUAL SABOTEURS OFTEN COMPLETE THEIR MISSIONS, BUT MOST LARGE RAIDING PARTIES HAVE BEEN QUICKLY SPOTTED AND MOPPED UP BY THE RED CHINESE . CHING-KUO HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN ACCUSED OF ENGAGING IN SECRET TALKS WITH PEKING, PRESUMABLY WITH THE OBJECT OF MAKING A DEAL AFTER THE GIMO'S DEATH . THOSE WHO KNOW HIM BEST SCOFF AT THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD EVER HAND FORMOSA OVER TO PEKING . SINO-MARXIST AMALGAM . WITH NO FORMAL UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, CHING-KUO COMMANDS LITTLE LOYALTY AMONG NATIONALIST CHINA'S INTELLECTUALS, AND HIS NONCONFORMIST METHODS IRRITATE THE TOP POLITICIANS OF THE KUOMINTANG . HE IS BACKED BY HIS DASHING HALF BROTHER, MAJOR GENERAL CHIANG WEI-KUO, 47 . AS MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO IN THE CABINET AND SPECIAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT, CHINGKUO WORKS CLOSELY WITH HIS FATHER . ANOTHER SOURCE OF STRENGTH IS CHING-KUO'S 100,000-MAN YOUTH CORPS, AND HIS VETO POWER OVER PROMOTIONS IN THE ARMY GIVES HIM ENORMOUS INFLUENCE WITH JUNIOR OFFICERS . WITH HIS TWO OLDER CHILDREN MARRIED, CHING-KUO LIVES IN A MODEST HOME IN TAIPEI WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNGER SONS . HIS DAY BEGINS AT 6 : 00 A.M . WITH AN HOUR'S PRACTICE IN CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY AND PAINTING, AND CONTINUES IN HIS OFFICE UNTIL MIDNIGHT . HE LIKES HIKING IN THE MOUNTAINS, BUT SINCE SUFFERING FROM MILD DIABETES HAS HAD TO FORGO CONVIVIAL DRINKING MOSTLY VODKA . ONE OLD FRIEND SEES CHING-KUO AS \" AN AMALGAM OF THE CHINESE TRADITION AND MARXIST IDEAS . / WHAT STRIKES MOST OBSERVERS IS HIS STRANGE COMBINATION OF SHYNESS AND POWER . A CHINESE FRIEND PERHAPS PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID, \" LOOK AT HIS HANDS THERE'S THE MAN : COARSE, TOUGH,PATIENT . \" AS HIS TRIP TO WASHINGTON NEARED ITS END LAST WEEK, THE MYSTERY MAN MET NEWSMEN, WHO FOUND HIM SEATED ON A GOLD-EMBROIDERED SOFA IN THE CHINESE EMBASSY . RED CHINA, SAID CHING-KUO THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER, IS AT ITS WEAKEST POINT IN HISTORY AND FORMOSA CORRESPONDINGLY AT ITS STRONGEST . HIS VISIT WAS INTENDED TO BRING ABOUT \" COMMON UNDERSTANDING \" BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND THE U.S . DID THAT MEAN THERE WERE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ? CHING-KUO REPLIED WITH A LOUD \" NO ! \" EVEN BEFORE THE QUESTION WAS TRANSLATED . WITH A BRISK, \" THAT'S ALL, \" THE INTERVIEW WAS CONCLUDED, AND CHING-KUO DROVE OFF TO PRINCETON, N.J., TO ENJOY THE ONE U.S . EXPERIENCE HE HAD INSISTED UPON STAYING AT A MOTEL .\n",

POSSIBLY DETERMINED NEVER TO GET HIMSELF ON THE SAME VULNERABLE SPOT, SIHANOUK MOVED QUICKLY TO LESSEN HIS DEPENDENCE ON THE U.S . OPENING TO THE SEINE . FOR ALL HIS ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR, SIHANOUK HAS ALSO SOMETIMES PROVED HIMSELF A SHREWD POLITICIAN . SINCE INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE TEN YEARS AGO, HE HAS JAILED HOME-GROWN COMMUNISTS AND WOOED HIS RED-HOT YOUNG LEFTIST CRITICS INTO THE GOVERNMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING WARM RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND RED CHINA . SIHANOUK LAST WEEK PERFORMED ANOTHER TYPICALLY SLIPPERY GYRATION . INSTEAD OF RUSHING RIGHT INTO PEKING'S ARMS, HE TURNED TO HIS OLD COLONIAL TUTOR, FRANCE, AND ASKED HER TO HELP REPLACE U.S . AID . SAID THE PRINCE : \" FOR OUR COUNTRY, LIBERATED FROM THE U.S . AND WHICH THE COMMUNIST POWERS DO NOT WISH TO TAKE IN CHARGE, IT COULD BE THE HOUR OF FRANCE . \" THE INVITATION WAS ANOTHER POTENTIAL OPENING FOR CHARLES DE GAULLE, WHO WANTS TO WHEEL AND DEAL IN THE AREA OF FRANCE'S OLD INDO-CHINA EMPIRE (HE KEEPS SUGGESTING A \" NEUTRALIZED \" VIET NAM, HINTED LAST WEEK THAT FRANCE MAY ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM) . BUT WHETHER PARIS WILL FILL THE GAP TO BE LEFT BY THE ELIMINATION OF A $30 MILLION ANNUAL U.S . DOLE REMAINS TO BE SEEN . FRANCE HAS BEEN SUPPLYING CAMBODIA ONLY ONE TENTH THE U.S.'S CONTRIBUTION, MOSTLY TO MAINTAIN A 300-MAN FORCE TRAINING THE CAMBODIAN ARMY . AT WEEK'S END THE PRINCE CLIMAXED HIS PERPLEXING THEATRICS BY CALLING IN THE PRESS CORPS, DELIVERING A MEANDERING MONOLOGUE INTERSPERSED WITH GIGGLES . PROUDLY, HE ANNOUNCED THAT RED CHINA HAD OFFERED HIM MILITARY SUPPORT . \" I THINK I HAVE ACHIEVED A BALANCE OF MENACES, \" HE SAID . \" THE MENACE OF THE IMPERIALISTS AND THEIR LACKEYS IS COUNTERBALANCED BY THE MENACE OF COMMUNIST CHINA, OUR NO . 1 FRIEND . \" BUT HE INDICATED THAT HE WOULD HAVE ONLY FOUR CHINESE CIVILIAN ADVISERS AND NO CHINESE MILITARY ADVISERS : \" EVERYWHERE IN OUR ARMY THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE POWER HELPING US FRANCE . \" ADDED THE PRINCE : \" I DO NOT LIKE TO BE A SATELLITE .

WITH FULL-SCALE CIVIL WAR THREATENING TO BREAK OUT ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES, KONG LE EVACUATED THE WIVES AND CHILDREN OF HIS MEN TO THE LAOTIAN CAPITAL OF VIENTIANE, 120 MILES AWAY .

THE GOVERNMENT COULD POINT OUT THAT THE STRETCH OF TRACK WHERE THE COLLISION OCCURRED WAS EQUIPPED WITH MODERN SAFETY DEVICES BUT THEY PROVED USELESS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CHAIN OF EVENTS, FROM THE DERAILMENT OF THE FREIGHT CARS TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE THIRD TRAIN, TOOK LESS THAN 30 SECONDS . FEW JAPANESE HAD HEART TO ENTER THE ARGUMENT ; THEY WERE TOO BUSY BURYING THE DEAD AND WORRYING ABOUT THE SURVIVORS . OF THE 274 HOSPITALIZED MINERS, AN ALARMING 100 WERE SUFFERING FROM AMNESIA . AS TRAFFIC RESUMED ON THE TOKYO-YOKOHAMA LINE, THE TRAINS MOVED SLOWLY PAST TSURUMI AND SOBBING PASSENGERS DROPPED BOUQUETS AT THE ACCIDENT SPOT .

HE WAS AWARE ONLY OF THE GRASS TICKLING HIS LEGS, THE FUN-CRUNCH OF DRY LEAVES, THE SCENT OF PINE NEEDLES, THE ZIGZAG FLIGHT OF A BUTTERFLY .

HE WAS TRIED, CONVICTED, AND SENTENCED TO HANG . TWO OUT OF 40 . LAST WEEK, EIGHT YEARS AFTER HIS LAST APPEAL WAS DENIED, HIRASAWA, NOW 72, WAS STILL IN JAIL UNDER A DEATH SENTENCE JAPANESE ARTISTS, WRITERS AND INTELLECTUALS HAVE RALLIED TO HIS SUPPORT AND LAWYERS HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST THE SEVERITY OF THE SENTENCE . \" IT SEEMS TO ME, \" SAYS ONE FORMER TOKYO MAGISTRATE, \" THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS PRETTY FLIMSY . \" THE JUDGE MIGHT HAVE A POINT . HIRASAWA INSISTED THAT THE REPUDIATED CONFESSION WAS EXTRACTED FROM HIM BY TORTURE IN A BRUTAL NONSTOP INTERROGATION . LATER, THE PAINTER'S TWO SONS-IN-LAW CLAIMED THAT HE WAS PLAYING CARDS WITH THEM AT THE TIME OF THE ROBBERY . ONLY TWO OF THE 40 EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED HIRASAWA AS THE ROBBER AND BOTH WERE INCREASINGLY UNSURE AS THE TRIAL WORE ON . THE ONLY CLUE POINTING TO HIRASAWA WAS THE CALLING CARD OF THE SUPPOSED HEALTH INSPECTOR, WHICH THE ROBBER HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THE BANK ; HANDWRITING EXPERTS DETERMINED THAT THE WRITING ON THE BACK OF THE CARD WAS HIRASAWA'S .

WHEN SYRIAN SOLDIERS SENT BURSTS OF TRACER BULLETS STREAKING AGAINST THE NIGHT SKY, THE RADIO ANNOUNCER HASTILY TOLD HIS EXCITED LISTENERS THAT IT WAS NOT REVOLUTION BUT JUBILATION . THE DREAM HAS COME TRUE ! HEADLINED A BEIRUT PAPER . ALEPPO NEARLY EXPLODED : ITS MAIN STREETS BECAME A SEA OF SCREAMING HUMANITY, AND CARS INCHED ALONG HONKING THEIR HORNS TO THE RHYTHM, \" NAS-SER ! \" ALGERIA'S PREMIER AHMED BEN BELLA CABLED THAT THIS WAS \" THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY OF MY LIFE ! \" AND YEMEN'S STRONGMAN, ABDULLAH SALLAL, HAILED THE \" OUTSTANDING HISTORIC EVENT . \" CHEERING CROWDS MILLED THROUGH ADEN AND KUWAIT AND BAGHDAD . FESTERING WOUND . WHAT THRILLED THE ARAB WORLD WAS THE CAIRO ANNOUNCEMENT THAT EGYPT, SYRIA AND IRAQ HAD AT LAST AGREED TO UNITE IN A TRIPARTITE FEDERATION . THE TERMS OF UNION WERE FAR STRONGER AND MORE CENTRALIZED THAN ARABS, OR ANYONE ELSE, HAD EXPECTED . THERE HAD BEEN MUCH TALK OF A LOOSE ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS MOVING SLOWLY OVER THE YEARS TOWARD ACTUAL UNITY . BUT THE PULSING ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOMENT APPARENTLY SWEPT ASIDE MUCH OF THE EARLIER RESTRAINT . A FEW DOZEN MEN IN CAIRO WERE GROPING FOR THE POLITICAL BLUEPRINT FOR A NATION STRONGER, RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY ARAB STATE FOR CENTURIES PAST . IF IT ALL WORKS OUT, THE PROPOSED NEW MIDDLE EASTERN POWER COMPLEX WILL COVER 620,300 SQ . MI., STRETCH FROM THE BORDERS OF TURKEY AND IRAN TO SUDAN AND LIBYA, FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AND FAR DOWN THE RED SEA COAST . IT WOULD HAVE A POPULATION OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE (EXPECTED TO REACH 80 MILLION BY 1985, GREATER THAN THE LARGEST NATION OF WESTERN EUROPE) AND A TOTAL GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT OF $5.7 BILLION . HERO OF THE HOUR WAS EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . BETTER THAN ANY MAN, HE KNEW THAT, ON THE HISTORICAL RECORD, THE ODDS WERE AGAINST SUCCESS . TIME AND AGAIN, THE CHERISHED DREAM OF ARAB ONENESS HAS BEEN SHATTERED ON THE IRRATIONALITY OF ARAB BEHAVIOR, ON PERSONAL RIVALRIES, AMBITIONS, CLASS DIFFERENCES AND COMPLICATED LEVANTINE INTRIGUES . AMID SHOUTS OF ARAB JOY, EGYPT AND SYRIA FORGED THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC IN 1958, ONLY TO SEE IT COLLAPSE IN A WELTER OF BICKERING THREE YEARS LATER . DURING THE PAST FIVE WEEKS OF NEGOTIATIONS IN CAIRO, RUMORS SPREAD OF WRANGLING AND DISSENSION BETWEEN NASSER ON ONE SIDE AND THE SYRIAN AND IRAQI LEADERS OF THE SOCIALIST BAATH PARTY ON THE OTHER . BOTH PICKED AT THE \" FESTERING WOUND \" CAUSED BY BAATH'S BREAKUP OF THE EARLIER, ILL-STARRED UNION OF EGYPT AND SYRIA IN THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . EACH PUT THE BLAME FOR FAILURE ON THE OTHER . FINALLY, AT A PLENARY SESSION IN THE GILTAND-CREAM GREAT HALL OF KUBBAH PALACE, NASSER PROPOSED A SHARING OF GUILT . \" THE PRESENCE OF BAATH IN THE ARAB HOMELAND IS A NECESSITY, \" HE DECLARED . \" THE RESIGNATION OF THE BAATH MINISTERS FROM THE U.A.R . GOVERNMENT IN 1961 WAS A MISTAKE . ACCEPTING THE RESIGNATIONS WAS ALSO A MISTAKE . \" THE BAATHIST DELEGATES CLAPPED AND CHEERED THIS BURYING OF THE HATCHET . IN A STARTLINGLY UN-ARAB SPIRIT OF AMITY AND COMPROMISE, BOTH SIDES ACCEPTED THE OTHER'S GOOD FAITH AND MINIMUM TERMS . CHEERFUL BORROWING . THE POINTS OF AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED BY EGYPT'S PREMIER ALI SABRY INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATE RETAINING THE NAME OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, WITH CAIRO AS ITS CAPITAL . ALL CITIZENS WOULD SHARE ONE NATIONALITY, BUT EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS WOULD BE SELF-GOVERNING AND IN CONTROL OF ITS SEPARATE ECONOMY . THE OVERALL GOVERNMENT BASED IN CAIRO WOULD HAVE A SINGLE PRESIDENT (ALMOST CERTAINLY NASSER), A PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL WITH MEMBERS FROM EACH REGION AND A BICAMERAL LEGISLATURE : A HOUSE WITH ONE MEMBER FOR EACH 60,000 CITIZENS, AND A SENATE REPRESENTING THE REGIONS EQUALLY WITHOUT REGARD TO POPULATION . THE ARAB PRESS CHEERFULLY ADMITTED THAT MUCH WAS BORROWED FROM THE U.S . CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT PROVIDED THE \" IDEAL FORM OF UNION AS PROVEN BY EXPERIENCE . \" STICKING POINT IS NASSER'S INSISTENCE ON A SINGLE POLITICAL PARTY FOR THE WHOLE U.A.R., MODELED ON HIS OWN ARAB SOCIALIST UNION IN EGYPT . SINCE THIS WOULD SWALLOW UP AND PROBABLY DESTROY THE BAATH MOVEMENT, BAATHISTS HAVE HELD OUT FOR A LOOSER, MORE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE BAATH-CREATED NATIONAL FRONT IN IRAQ, AND THE BAATHIST-NASSERITE UNIONIST FRONT IN SYRIA . IN THE END, NASSER WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HIS WAY ON THIS, AS ON OTHER LIMITATIONS TO POLITICAL DEMOCRACY . A CAIRO SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED, IN A PHRASE DEFINITELY NOT BORROWED FROM U.S . DEMOCRACY, THAT \" FREEDOM WILL BE GUARANTEED TO THE PEOPLE, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE . \" THERE ARE MANY LESSER MATTERS STILL TO BE DECIDED . COMMITTEES WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO WORK OUT DETAILS OF CURRENCY, CUSTOMS, POSTAGE, DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER POLICIES . FOREIGN AFFAIRS WOULD BE UNDER THE NEW U.A.R . GOVERNMENT, AND EMBASSIES ABROAD WOULD BE MERGED . THE U.A.R., HOWEVER, MAY TRY TO HANG ON TO ITS THREE UNITED NATIONS SEATS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT THE SOVIET UNION CONTROLS THE VOTES OF THE UKRAINE AND BYELORUSSIA . FREED SLAVES . MANY OBSERVERS SUSPECT THAT THIS NEW SHIP OF STATE MAY GO SWIFTLY ON THE ROCKS, BUT FEW OF THEM ARE IN THE ARAB WORLD . TWELVE MEMBERS OF OIL-RICH KUWAIT'S 50-MAN LEGISLATURE FORMALLY REQUESTED UNITY WITH THE U.A.R . EVEN NASSER'S TRADITIONAL ENEMIES, THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, MADE EFFORTS AT RECONCILIATION . JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN DISCREETLY LET 56 NASSERITE AND BAATHIST POLITICAL PRISONERS OUT OF JAIL AND SENT OFF FRIENDLY FEELERS TO NASSER . IN SAUDI ARABIA, ALARMED BY A PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATION THAT COST 19 LIVES, PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL TRIED TO MODERNIZE HIS REGIME BY ALLOTTING $1,200,000 AS COMPENSATION TO SLAVE OWNERSWHO WOULD FREE THEIR CHATTELS . AT WEEK'S END CAIRO RADIO WAS SPREADING WORD OF A CEASE-FIRE BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT IN REBELLION-TORN YEMEN . IT SAID THAT SAUDI ARABIA WAS PREPARED TO STOP SUPPLYING THE ROYALISTS SUPPORTING EX-IMAM BADR WITH MONEY AND MUNITIONS, WHILE NASSER MAY WITHDRAW A TOKEN CONTINGENT OF HIS 28,000-MAN EGYPTIAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BY APRIL 20 . THOUGH NASSER'S BROADCASTERS ARE NOT THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCES IN THE WORLD, THINGS MAY WELL COME TO THIS, FOR WITHOUT DOUBT JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AND ALL OTHER ARABS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANGERING NASSER\n",

BUT NASSER HAD CONTRIBUTED LITTLE TO THE VICTORIES THAT WERE ACTUALLY WON IN BOTH COUNTRIES BY A COALITION OF NASSERITE ARMY OFFICER AND POLITICIANS OF THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH HAS LONG PROMOTED THE IDEAL OF WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS) .

TWO VAST OILFIELDS HAVE BEEN TAPPED BY BRITISH DRILLING TEAMS, ONE AT MURBAN IN THE SANDY INTERIOR, THE OTHER IN THE SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS OF THE GULF . CONSERVATIVE OILMEN ESTIMATE ABU DHABI'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES AT ABOUT 3.8 BILLION BBL., WHICH AT PRESENT ROYALTY RATES WOULD RETURN SOME $1.4 BILLION OVER THE YEARS . RIDICULOUS, SAY OTHER EXPERTS : ON THE BASIS OF LATEST DISCOVERIES, RESERVES MAY BE AS GREAT AS 38 BILLION BBL . THIS HAS ALL BEEN RATHER UNSETTLING TO ABU DHABI, WHOSE 15,000 BEDOUINS HAVE GOT ALONG FOR CENTURIES ON PIRACY, PEARL FISHING AND INTERTRIBAL RAIDS . IN THE 19TH CENTURY, THE SWIFT PIRATE DHOWS WERE SWEPT FROM THE GULF BY BRITAIN, WHICH ESTABLISHED \" A PERPETUAL MARITIME TRUCE \" HENCE THE NAME TRUCIAL STATES, GIVEN TO ABU DHABI AND SIX OTHER SHEIKDOMS . PEARL FISHING BECAME UNPROFITABLE WHEN THE JAPANESE CLEVERLY INTRODUCED CULTURED PEARLS TO THE WORLD . THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO ABU DHABI BUT INTRIGUE : OF THE TWELVE PREDECESSORS OF THE PRESENT SHEIK, ONLY THREE DIED PEACEFULLY IN THEIR PALACE BEDS . THE REST WERE EITHER MURDERED OR VIOLENTLY DEPOSED, USUALLY BY CLOSE RELATIVES .

IN HIS LONG YEARS OF OIL-LESS RULE, SHEIK SHAKHBUT RAN HIS COUNTRY ON CUSTOMS DUTIES OF $140,000 A YEAR, FOUGHT SOME DESULTORY WARS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS IN SHARJA AND DUBAI, AND LIVED QUIETLY IN HIS MUD-WALLED PALACE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND . HE INSTALLED AN AIR CONDITIONER IN HIS BEDROOM BUT SELDOM USED IT BECAUSE HE DISLIKED THE NOISE .

AIMING TO \" HUMANIZE COMMUNISM, \" KADAR HAS SACKED STALINIST POLITICAL HACKS, APPOINTED NON-COMMUNISTS TO CABINET POSTS, AND ALLOWED NONPARTY MEMBERS TO SERVE IN THE PARLIAMENT . HE HAS GRANTED AMNESTY TO THOUSANDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ENCOURAGED REFUGEES WHO FLED IN 1956 TO RETURN WITH FREE PARDONS ; TODAY THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF 1956'S 200,000 REFUGEES HAVE COME BACK HOME . WORKER MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS NOT A SURE GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS . \" WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE RED BLOODS THE SAME PRIVILEGE ONCE ENJOYED BY BLUEBLOODS, \" SAYS KADAR . TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON U.S . DIPLOMATS IN BUDAPEST HAVE BEEN LIFTED, ENABLING THEM TO GO ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY EXCEPT TO MILITARY ZONES . DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BEING CARRIED ON WITH THE VATICAN OVER THE FUTURE OF JOSEF CARDINAL MINDSZENTY, WHO IS STILL IN ASYLUM AT THE U.S .

FIRST SIGNS OF A RAPPORT WITH ROME APPEARED WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD APPROVE POPE PAUL'S ASSIGNMENT OF SIX NEW CATHOLIC BISHOPS TO VACANT HUNGARIAN SEES . BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO LET OTHER BISHOPS AND SOME 1,000 PRIESTS PERFORM THEIR DUTIES . OFF TO BELGRADE . MORE THAN 90 PER CENT OF HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN COLLECTIVIZED, BUT FARMERS CAN USE STATE MACHINERY TO CULTIVATE THEIR OWN TINY PLOTS . INCREASINGLY, THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CHANNEL A LARGER PART OF THE ECONOMY INTO THE PRODUCTION OF CONSUMER GOODS . TODAY SOME HUNGARIAN GYPSIES ACTUALLY HAVE TV SETS THOUGH THEY OFTEN GO AROUND BAREFOOT . HUNGARY, OF COURSE, IS STILL A TOTALITARIAN STATE . WATCHTOWERS, MINEFIELDS AND BARBED-WIRE SEAL OFF THE COUNTRY FROM THE WEST . THOUGH THE MIDNIGHT KNOCK BY THE SECRET POLICE IS ALMOST A THING OF THE PAST, MORE THAN 40,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS AND THE HIDEOUS MEMORY OF 1956 STILL REMAIN . KADAR STEADFASTLY FOLLOWS EVERY NEW TWIST OF KREMLIN POLICY . NO SOONER HAD NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV LEFT YUGOSLAVIA AFTER MAKING HIS PEACE WITH MARSHAL TITO THAN KADAR MADE PLANS TO VISIT BELGRADE THIS WEEK, SEEKING TO STRENGTHEN HUNGARY'S ECONOMIC, DIPLOMATIC AND CULTURAL TIES WITH THE ONETIME \" REVISIONIST \" BAD BOY OF THE SATELLITES . NEVER IN HUNGARY . BUT KADAR'S LIBERALIZATION DOES PERMIT HUNGARIANS TO LAUGH AT THEMSELVES AND AT THEIR REGIME AS LONG AS COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY ITSELF IS NOT ATTACKED .

IT WOULD ALSO NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO COVER THE GREEN TRACK SIGNAL BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A COVER SHORTAGE . IN ADDITION, A MAIL TRAIN HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO HOURS LATE . THE BANDITS LOADED THE MONEY THEY STOLE IN A TRUCK .

UP AND DOWN THE PERSIAN GULF, THE STATES OF QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND IRAN WERE ROLLING IN OIL WEALTH . BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, ABU DHABI'S 25,000 SQ . MI . OF SAND, DATE PALMS AND BARREN OFFSHORE ISLANDS JUST GOT HOTTER, MORE HUMID AND WINDSWEPT THAN BEFORE . PERPETUAL TRUCE . BUT THEN ALLAH RESPONDED TO THE SHEIK'S PRAYERS BELATEDLY, BUT IN OVERWHELMING MEASURE . TWO VAST OILFIELDS HAVE BEEN TAPPED BY BRITISH DRILLING TEAMS, ONE AT MURBAN IN THE SANDY INTERIOR, THE OTHER IN THE SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS OF THE GULF . CONSERVATIVE OILMEN ESTIMATE ABU DHABI'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES AT ABOUT 3.8 BILLION BBL., WHICH AT PRESENT ROYALTY RATES WOULD RETURN SOME $1.4 BILLION OVER THE YEARS . RIDICULOUS, SAY OTHER EXPERTS : ON THE BASIS OF LATEST DISCOVERIES, RESERVES MAY BE AS GREAT AS 38 BILLION BBL . THIS HAS ALL BEEN RATHER UNSETTLING TO ABU DHABI, WHOSE 15,000 BEDOUINS HAVE GOT ALONG FOR CENTURIES ON PIRACY, PEARL FISHING AND INTERTRIBAL RAIDS . IN THE 19TH CENTURY, THE SWIFT PIRATE DHOWS WERE SWEPT FROM THE GULF BY BRITAIN, WHICH ESTABLISHED \" A PERPETUAL MARITIME TRUCE \" HENCE THE NAME TRUCIAL STATES, GIVEN TO ABU DHABI AND SIX OTHER SHEIKDOMS . PEARL FISHING BECAME UNPROFITABLE WHEN THE JAPANESE CLEVERLY INTRODUCED CULTURED PEARLS TO THE WORLD . THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO ABU DHABI BUT INTRIGUE : OF THE TWELVE PREDECESSORS OF THE PRESENT SHEIK, ONLY THREE DIED PEACEFULLY IN THEIR PALACE BEDS . THE REST WERE EITHER MURDERED OR VIOLENTLY DEPOSED, USUALLY BY CLOSE RELATIVES . SHEIK SHAKHBUT TOOK OVER IN 1928 WHEN HIS UNCLE WAS ASSASSINATED, AFTER HAVING EARLIER KILLED SHAKHBUT'S FATHER WHO, IN TURN, HAD COME TO POWER BY KILLING HIS OLDER BROTHER . SHAKHBUT IS SAID TO HAVE RULED SO LONG AND SAFELY ONLY BECAUSE HIS OWN TWO BROTHERS SWORE A SOLEMN OATH ON THE KORAN NOT TO MURDER HIM . BUGS IN THE TREASURY . IN HIS LONG YEARS OF OIL-LESS RULE, SHEIK SHAKHBUT RAN HIS COUNTRY ON CUSTOMS DUTIES OF $140,000 A YEAR, FOUGHT SOME DESULTORY WARS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS IN SHARJA AND DUBAI, AND LIVED QUIETLY IN HIS MUD-WALLED PALACE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND . HE INSTALLED AN AIR CONDITIONER IN HIS BEDROOM BUT SELDOM USED IT BECAUSE HE DISLIKED THE NOISE . HE ALSO PUT IN A FLUSH TOILET AND A PUMP TO SUPPLY IT WITH WATER ; SEWAGE DISPOSAL WAS SIMPLY A PIPE JUTTING OUT FROM THE PALACE WALL . NEARLY EVERY DAY, THE SHEIK SAT CROSSLEGGED IN HIS THRONE ROOM HOLDING A MAJLIS, AT WHICH HE LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS OF CITIZENS, WHILE BEDOUIN CHIEFS GROUPED AROUND HIM, SOME HOLDING ON THEIR WRISTS THE HOODED FALCONS THAT WERE ABU DHABI'S ONLY STATUS SYMBOL . WHEN THE OIL REVENUES BEGAN TO FLOW IN LAST YEAR, EVERYONE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS OF SHEIK SHAKHBUT . BUT IT SOON DEVELOPED THAT WHAT SHAKHBUT LIKED TO DO WITH MONEY WAS COUNT IT, NOT SPEND IT . HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT CHECKS FROM THE OIL COMPANIES, AT FIRST KEPT HIS CASH UNDER HIS BED . WHEN THE BEDSPRINGS BEGAN TO BULGE, HE HAD THE CASH CARTED TO A PALACE DUNGEON . IT WAS ONLY AFTER RATS BEGAN NIBBLING AT THE TREASURE CHESTS AND INSECTS STARTED EATING THE FOLDING MONEY THAT SHAKHBUT RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF BANKING . HE NOW FLOURISHES AN OUTSIZE CHECKBOOK, EMBLAZONED WITH THE RED AND WHITE FLAG OF ABU DHABI, BUT HE STILL HATES TO SIGN CHECKS . PUTTING OFF PAYDAY . BRITAIN, WHICH HAS A MOTHER-HEN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ALLEGEDLY INDEPENDENT TRUCIAL STATES, LAST YEAR PROMOTED AN ABU DHABI DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CALLING FOR $70 MILLION WORTH OF ROADS, SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC WORKS . SHEIK SHAKHBUT, 58, ACCEPTED THE PLAN ONLY IN THEORY.BUSINESSMEN DEALING WITH THE SHEIK HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERNIGHT GREY HAIR . \" HE SIMPLY ASKS FOR 50 PER CENT IN EVERY BUSINESS DEAL ! / SPUTTERED A LEVANTINE ENTREPRENEUR . SHAKHBUT MAY AMIABLY CONCEDE THAT HE HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR WORK TO BE DONE, THEN ADDS CAGILY, \" BUT I DIDN'T SAY I WOULD PAY FOR IT . \" HIS PENNY PINCHING EVEN EXTENDS TO ABU DHABI'S 470-MAN ARMY : EACH SOLDIER IS PAID PERSONALLY BY SHAKHBUT, WHO STALLS OFF PAYDAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE . THE SHEIK'S MIND RESEMBLES A REVOLVING DOOR . SINCE ABU DHABI HAS VIRTUALLY NO WATER (A GLASS OF WATER COSTS ABOUT THE SAME AS A GLASS OF GIN), THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR MODERN EQUIPMENT TO DISTILL SEA WATER . BUT THE SHEIK HAS THREE TIMES SHIFTED THE LOCATION OF A PROPOSED NEW DISTILLATION PLANT AND MAY WELL SHIFT IT THREE OR 30 TIMES MORE . GROANED A FRUSTRATED BRITISH ENGINEER : \" WE FREQUENTLY DO SIX WEEKS' WORK FOR NOTHING . \" THE BRITISH PRODUCED PLANS TO MAKE ABU DHABI CITY INTO A GLITTERING MODERN CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE THE PRIDE OF THE PERSIAN GULF, BUT AS FAST AS ENGINEERS LAY OUT A NEW BOULEVARD, SHAKHBUT GRANTS PERMISSION TO A LOCAL MERCHANT TO BUILD A STORE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT . FISHY FRESHNESS . IN AN EFFORT TO BROADEN THE SHEIK'S OUTLOOK, OILMEN AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE GIVEN HIM REDCARPET TRIPS TO PARIS, LONDON AND NEW YORK . WHAT INTERESTED HIM MOST WAS THE LARGE NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILES IN THE THREE CITIES . \" KEEP THE CARS GOING, \" HE SAID EARNESTLY, THINKING HAPPILY OF THE FUTURE CONSUMPTION OF ABU DHABI GASOLINE . NEW YORK CITY STRUCK HIM AS A \" TOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT CIVILIZED . THEY LIVE LIKE ANTS OR SWALLOWS IN CLIFFS . THE SUN NEVER GETS DOWN INTO THE STREETS . \" HE WAS APPALLED BY TV WESTERNS : \" ALL THAT SHOOTING UPSETS THE BASIS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT ! \" WHAT DELIGHTS SHAKHBUT IS THE TRADITIONAL LIFE OF HIS PEOPLE . \" THE THING THAT PLEASES ME MOST, \" HE SAYS, \" IS HUNTING FOR BUSTARDS WITH OUR FALCONS . IT'S TREMENDOUS TO SEE THE FALCON FIGHTING THE BUSTARD AND KILLING IT . EACH FALCON HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL OWNER AND REFUSES TO HUNT FOR ANYONE ELSE . \" THE SHEIK IS ALSO A CONNOISSEUR OF CAMEL'S MILK HIS ONLY DRINK AND CAN TELL BY THE MILK'S TASTE WHAT THE CAMEL HAS BEEN EATING AND WHERE IT WAS IN THE DESERT FOR THE BEST MILK, HE EXPLAINS, WE FEED CAMELS ON SEA MANGROVE AND DRIED FISH . THIS GIVES THE MILK A SLIGHTLY FISHY FRESHNESS WE APPRECIATE . \" SHAKHBUT ONCE OWNED A CADILLAC, BUT WHEN IT FINALLY BROKE DOWN HE JUST ABANDONED IT . NOW HE MAKES HIS STATE VISITS IN A BONE-JARRING LAND-ROVER, BUT WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM . \" I DID ALL MY TRAVELING BY CAMEL IN THE OLD DAYS, \" HE SIGHS, \" BUT NOW I HAVE TO GO BY CAR BECAUSE IF THE RULER WENT BY CAMEL, PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT PECULIAR . /\n",

TO THE ARMY : PREPARE TO MOVE IN CASE THE ISRAELIS MIGHT BE THINKING OF INTERVENTION ; PLACE MISSILES ON LAUNCH PADS READY TO FIRE . THIS DONE, NASSER FINISHED DRESSING AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN, LONG DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD . PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF, WHO ONLY FOUR WEEKS BEFORE HAD OVERTHROWN ANOTHER ANTI-NASSER REGIME IN IRAQ, SOLICITOUSLY ASKED WHAT NASSER INTENDED DOING ABOUT SYRIA . NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOW SUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WAS BOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERE NOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NO FURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCH MILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE, CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARS AND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS .

IT WAS QUITE CLEAR LAST WEEK THAT THE LATEST SHAKE OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE RESULTED IN NEW PATTERNS AND ALIGNMENTS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELS PLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POURED INTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONG CONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARAB UNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, AND THE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTER OF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARAB STATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE AND ARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN, WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSER REBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUT HATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS AT THE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KING SAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LAST WEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDI ARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTS MAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THE SWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE IT COULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHEN AND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMID SERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS, YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKED SHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIAN SUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN AND OUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDI ARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT . NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHO RESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO INSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD IS INFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARE CAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS A FOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALL THE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICE OF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF \" VOICES \" (VOICE OF THE ARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICH BLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIAN ORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER . RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF SOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMED AT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING A NEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED AT DESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY, WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUT TO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UM KALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLY STIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILD THE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A NASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEM ARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDY SPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS . FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF SUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HE HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCE FEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS AND CONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT IS NASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARAB WORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THE MAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY . HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THE MIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENI TRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS . WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEP DESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIR CONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BEST HOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGION HANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIR DESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150 YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLS OF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE HEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WEST OVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT OR IMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE 16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS AND PASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WAR I, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS AND FOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES, MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, AND FRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THE COLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARAB NATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WAS SECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS AND BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL \" INVENTED \" THE STATE OF JORDAN \" ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . \" EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THE PARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS . HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT . HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THE MASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABS IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THAT ONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROM COLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTS AND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVED THAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLY ON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLY ORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'S ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY AS POPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEW SKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ON THE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THE STATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OF WHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICH WERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINET EL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ON THE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE ERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE, CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLOD UNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHT BRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIR GRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED, AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY AND DILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROM CAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THE NIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITOR SELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THE CAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED, WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK . SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMES THE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THE JEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHIN AT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OF THE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THE FELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSER EGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP IN THE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, \" I COULDN'T CARE LESS . \" TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE, TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY 1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THE REGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLY ACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN SWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP, COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'S FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLD WAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS AN INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA IS FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILL INCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000 ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THE U.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF SURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE (AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S . FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACT IS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OF POWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHT UNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BE REDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 A YEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THE GOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARE NOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGN ENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FAR LESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITS EDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZE NASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNED BECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, \" IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE WOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . \" THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERY VILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TO PASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES . NASSER'S REVOLUTION HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY TOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS A NASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERE SHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HAS LARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRST LEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THEN DEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND IS PERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA AND OTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES, WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'S GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWO EVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARE CRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS . IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATION PRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS . IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUT MERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE BIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST (A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISH THE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED IN PREGNANCY . THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACED BY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITS BORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS . INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT DISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OF GENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OF ARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEW GOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENT YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS AND INTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED, MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIAN WHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS AND HOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THE BRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVER HIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL, CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, AND CLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLE ABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINET MINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDED SHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS A DAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLE WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT A DAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICS AND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WAS A MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HE OVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS \" NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE WITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . \" HE DEFINES REVOLUTION AS \" THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE, WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . \" THE BAATH SLOGAN, \" UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, \" WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATED BY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE OVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TO IRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THE PARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASS INTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OF MILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS A DEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF 14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN . NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMED TAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTO ACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITY WAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ON THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THE SAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATED AS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODED BY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIAN ECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVES TRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL . AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINET MINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRY SECESSION FROM THE U.A.R . IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THE MOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN 1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTER OF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'S COMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILED AND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS AND PRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNIST ALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSER OFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONE WANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL RECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARAB UNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TO ACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, \" PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON A PROPER BASIS . \" MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : \" JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE WELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES AND RULERS . \" IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HE INTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATED UNION WITH SYRIA . \" THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, \" NASSER TOLD TIME LAST WEEK, \" WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION AND AMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES . \" TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIAN DELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH NASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED, HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE . THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TO CAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO . IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITH HARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING EVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS \" RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . \" SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATES WOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THAT THEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKS BETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHING CONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST, TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT . THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . IN DAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISON CELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS AS IDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . \" WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITH NASSER THE WAY WE WANT, \" HE SAID . \" WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPT THE WAY NASSER WANTS . \" BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINT MAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONS IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITION SQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR AN ADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES . ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HAS GIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : \" NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HIS HEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OF EXTERNAL EXPANSION . \" THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'S DREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UP ONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HER BORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO . MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WEST BANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN . BRITAIN'S PRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZING NASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THE BRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY, BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EAST COLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . \" NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OIL IS AMBIGUOUS, \" COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . \" OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . \" BRITISH AND U.S . OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'S INTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF 6,500,000 BBL . \" WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, \" SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL., BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRODUCER'S PROFITS . \" ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY, \" EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . \" IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITY AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . \" DRAWN LINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUS AT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HAS TURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN CAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOT INCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS AT ASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BE SINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOOD OF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HAS AIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUT THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . \" IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, \" SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S . CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB WORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO A PRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD . GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HIS EARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH \" IMPERIALIST \" GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEAN DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE \" KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDER JOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WE FACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS . / HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, \" IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S . STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFT A GOOD IMPRESSION . \" PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVE BECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . \" WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, \" SAYS NASSER . \" WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONEST AND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER . \" THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHO SPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HIS BRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS . THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S . DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : \" I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA . YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . \" JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END IN CAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BE WHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HE HAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HE APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OF JIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.S A DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HE STILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : \" I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTED HELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TO SAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD TECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . \" EVEN MORE THAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGING FROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( \" BETTER THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS \" ) . THERE ARE PROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER, OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, \" THE CAMEL DRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . \" BUT PROVERBS ARE ECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT WHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL, BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . FOR OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONS INVOLVED, ONLY HIS IN EGYPT HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED FOR A FULL TEN YEARS .\n",

THEY EVEN GINGERLY ACCEPTED THE NASSER-BAATH SLOGAN OF \" FREEDOM, UNITY, SOCIALISM, \" WITH ONLY THE SLIGHT AMENDMENT OF THE FINAL WORD TO READ \" A BETTER LIFE . \" WHAT WAS STILL UNCERTAIN LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER NASSER IS PREPARED TO DROP OR MODIFY HIS PRESENT DETERMINATION TO UNITE ONLY WITH \" LIBERATED \" ARAB STATES AND TO SHUN MONARCHIES . SAID NEW JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER RIFAI : \" WE HAVE OUR PRIDE . WE ARE JUST AS HEALTHY AND STRONG AS ANY ARAB STATE . WE DON'T INTEND TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING, BUT WE DO INTEND TO PROCLAIM OUR GOOD WILL AND OUR ATTACHMENT TO ARAB UNITY . \" THEN HE ADDED HOPEFULLY, \" THERE'S EVERY REASON FOR THE NEW ARAB UNION TO WELCOME JORDAN AND NO REASON TO BAR A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY .

BOTH BONN DECISIONS RAISED THE QUESTION OF JUST HOW MUCH THE FRANCO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATY IS WORTH, AND BROUGHT INTO THE OPEN THE FACT THAT WEST GERMANY STILL LOOKS TO THE U.S .

STUBBORNLY FRANCE PREPARED FOR ANOTHER ATOMIC TEST IN THE SAHARA, BUT DE GAULLE'S ASPIRATIONS TO FRENCH LEADERSHIP OF EUROPE WERE ACIDLY DEMOLISHED BY PARIS' LE FIGARO . \" IF KHRUSHCHEV REALLY BECOMES DISTURBED BY THE CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED AGAINST HIM BY CHINA, \" SAID THE PAPER, \" AND IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A CERTAINTY OF PEACE ON HIS WESTERN FRONT, THEN HE WILL NOT COME TO SEEK AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE, WHICH IS NEGLIGIBLE IN HIS EYES, EVEN WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS, BUT WITH THE U.S., WHOSE INFLUENCE AND POWER ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES SUPERIOR .

THE COUNTRY'S FIRST MINISTER OF EDUCATION, HE WAS ELECTED BY THE KNESSET TO FILL THE VACANCY CAUSED BY THE DEATH OF IZHAK BEN-ZVI LAST MONTH . RUSSIAN-BORN SHAZAR EMIGRATED TO PALESTINE VIA CENTRAL EUROPE DURING THE '20S, WAS HAND-PICKED FOR THE JOB BY AN OLD POLITICAL CRONY, PREMIER DAVID BEN-GURION . SHAZAR HAS ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION . AS BEN-GURION PUTS IT, HE IS \" A MAN WITHOUT ENEMIES . \" NORMALLY SOFT-SPOKEN, SHAZAR IS AN IMPASSIONED, SKILLFUL ORATOR WHEN HE GETS ONTO A SPEAKER'S PLATFORM . DURING LAST MONTH'S COMMEMORATION OF THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING, SHAZAR BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE TO TEARS SIMPLY BY REPEATING THE WORD \" WARSAW \" IN HUSHED TONES BEFORE BEGINNING HIS ADDRESS ; ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE WAS SO CARRIED AWAY BY HIS OWN ORATORY THAT HE FELL OFF THE STAGE AND HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A BADLY SPRAINED LEG . SHAZAR IS ALSO NOTORIOUSLY ABSENT-MINDED . YEARS AGO IN POLAND, THE STORY GOES, HE BOARDED A TRAIN ONLY TO FIND THAT HE HAD LOST HIS RAIL TICKET . ASSURED BY THE CONDUCTOR THAT HE COULD BUY ANOTHER, SHAZAR REPLIED : \" I KNOW, BUT IF I DON'T FIND THE TICKET I WON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING . / SHAZAR'S ORIGINAL SURNAME WAS RUBASHOV, BUT LIKE MANY VETERAN ZIONISTS, HE HEBRAIZED HIS NAME .

      "     Preview: CLOCK TICKED TOWARD STARTING TIME FOR THE GREAT DEBATE, THERE WERE ONLY TWO EMPTY SEATS IN THE JAMMED, EXPECTANT CHAMBER . THE FIRST WAS FILLED, WITH FOUR MINUTES TO SPARE, BY HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO SAT DOWN STIFFLY ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH, LOOKING AS CHILL AND WAN AS HIS EFFIGY AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S . TWO MINUTES LATER, A SHORT, PLUMP MAN IN A SHABBY GREY SUIT BUSTLED EXPRESSIONLESSLY DOWN THE GANGWAY, SANK INTO THE OPPOSITION FRONT BENCH FACING MACMILLAN, AND FINGERED A CARDBOARD FILE . AS THE CLOCK STRUCK, LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON ROSE TO HIS FEET AND FOR A SECOND SAVORED THE TINGLING SILENCE BEFORE BREAKING IT WITH HIS FLAT NASAL YORKSHIRE VOICE . \" THIS IS A DEBATE, \" HE BEGAN, \" WITHOUT PRECEDENCE IN THE ANNALS OF THE HOUSE . \" THE TWO MEN WERE THE PRODUCTS OF TWO REMARKABLE POLITICAL CAREERS AND ALSO OF TWO BRITAINS : MACMILLAN, THE SKILLFUL, COURAGEOUS AND OFTEN RUTHLESS PATRICIAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIS COUNTRY FROM THE DEBRIS OF SUEZ AND LED IT INTO AN ERA OF UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY ; HAROLD WILSON, THE DRY, DILIGENT AND OFTEN DEVIOUS SON OF A PROVINCIAL CHEMIST WHO HAD RISEN BY HARD WORK AND CHANCE (INCLUDING THE DEATH OF THE MAN HE SUCCEEDED, HUGH GAITSKELL) TO THE TOP OF THE LABOR PARTY . AS HE FACED MACMILLAN, WHO HAD GONE TO OXFORD BY FAMILY TRADITION, HAROLD WILSON, WHO HAD GONE TO OXFORD ON A SCHOLARSHIP, STROVE TO EMBODY A NEW, IMPATIENT, CLASS-DEFYING ENGLAND . THE MORAL DECAY SURROUNDING THE PROFUMO AFFAIR, HE TRIED HARD TO SUGGEST, MUST BE BLAMED ON THE TORIES . REFERRING TO CHRISTINE KEELER'S REPORTED $14,000-A-WEEK NIGHTCLUB CONTRACT, WILSON DECLARED : \" THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY NAUSEATING ABOUT A SYSTEM OF SOCIETY WHICH PAYS A HARLOT 25 TIMES AS MUCH AS IT PAYS ITS PRIME MINISTER . \" FOR THE REST, HAROLD WILSON STUCK TO THE SECURITY ISSUE AND THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE PROFUMO CASE, WHICH HE ATTACKED AS EITHER DISHONEST OR INCOMPETENT, OR BOTH . LET DOWN . THE ONCE UNFLAPPABLE MACMILLAN FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT AND KEPT DABBING AT THE POUCHES BENEATH HIS EYES WITH A CRUMPLED HANDKERCHIEF . WHEN HE ROSE, HE OPENLY PLAYED FOR THE SYMPATHY OF HIS COLLEAGUES . \" WHAT HAS HAPPENED, \" HE SAID, \" HAS INFLICTED A DEEP, BITTER AND LASTING WOUND ON ME . \" ESSENTIALLY HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN GROSSLY DECEIVED BY PROFUMO AN \" ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE \" CULPRIT AND BADLY LET DOWN BY HIS SUBORDINATES, WHO FAILED TO KEEP HIM INFORMED . FROM THE BACK BENCHES CAME A RUDE GIBE OF \" NOBODY EVER TELLS ME NUFFIN ! \" BY THE TIME MACMILLAN FINISHED, THE HOUSE WAS PREPARED TO ACQUIT HIM OF PERSONAL DISHONESTY AND MORAL TURPITUDE, BUT HE HAD CONVICTED HIMSELF OF NEGLIGENCE AND NAIVETE OR PERHAPS SIMPLY OF A FATAL ABILITY TO AVERT HIS EYES FROM WHAT HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE . IN THE VOTE FOLLOWING THE DEBATE, 27 CONSERVATIVES VOTED AGAINST MACMILLAN OR ABSTAINED . ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE CRIES OF \" RESIGN, RESIGN, \" AND THIS IS WHAT MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO THE ONLY REMAINING QUESTION BEING WHEN . THE WARNING . THE LONG DEBATE SERVED TO FIX GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY, OR THE LACK OF IT, AND ILLUSTRATED THE ODD NATURE OF THE BRITISH SECURITY SYSTEM, COMPOUNDED OF SHREWDNESS, INEFFICIENCY, AND AN OFTEN MISGUIDED SENSE OF SPORTSMANSHIP THAT GOES TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS IN PROTECTING MEMBERS OF THE CLUB . THE CASE, AS IT EMERGED FROM THE DEBATE, FALLS INTO FOUR PHASES . FIRST, THERE WAS THE CHRISTINE-PROFUMO AFFAIR ITSELF, WHICH, ACCORDING TO PROFUMO, LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS, FROM JULY TO DECEMBER 1961, BUT BY OTHER EVIDENCE POSSIBLY LASTED LONGER . DURING THOSE SAME MONTHS, CHRISTINE ALSO ENTERTAINED RUSSIAN ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV, WHO HAD BEEN PALS FOR SOME TIME WITH HER MENTOR, DR . STEPHEN WARD . MI-5, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE, APPARENTLY DISCOVERED ONLY HALF OF WHAT WILSON SCATHINGLY CALLED \" THIS DINGY QUADRILATERAL . \" IN AUGUST 1961, ACCORDING TO THE COMMONS DEBATE, CABINET SECRETARY SIR NORMAN BROOK WARNED PROFUMO THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE SECRETARY FOR WAR NOT TO BE TOO FRIENDLY WITH WARD ; HE DID NOT MENTION, AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, CHRISTINE . NOTHING OF THIS WAS REPORTED TO MACMILLAN . IN THE SECOND PHASE, WHICH COVERS MOST OF 1962, RUMORS OF THE AFFAIR KEPT REACHING THE NEWSPAPERS, TORY AND LABOR POLITICIANS, BUT APPARENTLY NOT THE PRIME MINISTER . DURING THE CUBA BLOWUP, WARD WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, SUGGESTING TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE THAT HIS FRIEND IVANOV BE USED AS AN INTERMEDIARY TO HELP SETTLE THE CRISIS . BUT SAID MACMILLAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE THEN TRYING TO GET INTO THE ACT \" TO WEAKEN OUR RESOLUTION . \" A LITTLE LATER, WILSON HIMSELF GOT A LETTER FROM WARD, BOASTING OF HIS SUPPOSED HELP IN SETTLING THE CUBA MATTER, BUT FILED IT AWAY AS COMING FROM A CRANK . BEFORE IVANOV WAS RECALLED TO MOSCOW IN JANUARY 1963, HE AROUSED SUSPICION IN OTHER WAYS . A BRIDGE PLAYER WHO TOOK A HAND IN SOME VERY HIGH-LEVEL GAMES, HE LOST STEADILY, AS MUCH AS $140 A NIGHT . \" I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S PETTY CASH WOULD STAND SUCH LOSSES EVERY NIGHT, \" SAID ONE LABOR M.P . CAUSTICALLY, / UNLESS THEY GOT SOMETHING FOR IT . \" THE VIGIL . IN THE THIRD AND MOST REMARKABLE PHASE, MACMILLAN FINALLY BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A PROFUMO CASE . IN JANUARY 1963, AS MACMILLAN TOLD COMMONS POLICE LEARNED FROM CHRISTINE THAT WARD HAD ASKED HER TO FIND OUT FROM PROFUMO WHEN THE U.S . WAS TO DELIVER CERTAIN NUCLEAR INFORMATION AND WARHEADS TO WEST GERMANY (SHE SAID THAT SHE REFUSED TO DO IT) . MACMILLAN WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS EITHER . BUT WHILE HE WAS AWAY IN ITALY, THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HUGE (CIRC . 6,500,000) NEWS OF THE WORLD REPORTED THE PROFUMO RUMORS TO MACMILLAN'S PRINCIPAL PRIVATE SECRETARY . CONFRONTED WITH THE STORY, PROFUMO DENIED EVERYTHING TO SEVERAL OFFICIALS ; THE RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN INNOCENT, HE SAID, AND ANYWAY HAD ENDED LONG BEFORE . WHY DIDN'T THE PRIME MINISTER QUESTION PROFUMO HIMSELF AT ANY TIME ? MACMILLAN'S LAME ANSWER : HE ASSUMED THAT PROFUMO WOULD SPEAK MORE FREELY TO OTHERS, AND FURTHERMORE SUCH AN INTERROGATION WOULD HAVE MADE \" SOCIAL RELATIONS \" BETWEEN HIMSELF AND PROFUMO HIGHLY EMBARRASSING . AND WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ATTEMPT TO INTERROGATE CHRISTINE HERSELF TO CHECK OUT PROFUMO'S DENIAL ? TO THIS, MACMILLAN HAD NO ANSWER AT ALL . AFTER CHRISTINE FAILED TO APPEAR AS A WITNESS LAST MARCH IN THE TRIAL OF A JEALOUS NEGRO LOVER WHO HAD TRIED TO SHOOT HER, QUESTIONS WERE FINALLY RAISED IN PARLIAMENT . MACMILLAN ASKED FOR ACTION, ADMITTEDLY HOPING FOR A STATEMENT FROM PROFUMO THAT WOULD QUELL FURTHER RUMORS IN THE PRESS THROUGH FEAR OF LIBEL . WHEN THE HOUSE ADJOURNED AFTER MIDNIGHT, PROFUMO WAS AWAKENED, AND AT 1 : 30 A.M . CAME TO CHIEF TORY WHIP MARTIN REDMAYNE'S COMMONS OFFICE WITH HIS SOLICITOR . HE WAS CONFRONTED BY REDMAYNE, TORY CHAIRMAN IAIN MACLEOD, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO WILLIAM DEEDES, ATTORNEY GENERAL SIR JOHN HOBSON AND SOLICITOR GENERAL SIR PETER RAWLINSON . TWO OF PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS HAD BEEN AT HARROW WITH HIM . WHERE LAST WEEK HE WAS EXPELLED FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DISMISSED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, AND SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL . THE LETTER . UNDER FRIENDLY QUESTIONING UNTIL 5 A.M., PROFUMO DENIED MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE . HE AGREED TO MAKE A SACROSANCT \" PERSONAL STATEMENT, \" ASSURING THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED \" NO IMPROPRIETY WHATSOEVER \" WITH MISS KEELER . HIS FELLOW MINISTERS SUGGESTED THAT HE ADMIT AT LEAST TO BEING \" ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH HER, \" ALTHOUGH IT \" SOUNDED SO AWFUL, \" AS PROFUMO PUT IT . \" WE INSISTED THAT IT MUST BE INCLUDED, \" EXPLAINED MACLEOD FATUOUSLY LAST WEEK, \" BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE TRUTH . \" AGAINST HIMSELF AND THE FOUR OTHER MINISTERS, MACLEOD ADDED, \" TWO POSSIBLE CHARGES CAN BE BROUGHT . FIRST, THAT WE WERE CONSPIRING KNAVES, AND SECONDLY, THAT WE WERE GULLIBLE FOOLS . \" THEY WERE INDEED GULLIBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WANTED TO BE . EVEN THE MOST CURSORY CHECKING WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THAT WHILE CHRISTINE MAY HAVE HAD JOIE DE VIVRE, SHE HAD LITTLE DISCRETION . PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS KNEW BY THEN ABOUT A LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 BEGINNING \" DARLING . . . \" PROFUMO EXPLAINED, AS MACMILLAN PUT IT, THAT IN HIS CIRCLES \" IT WAS A TERM OF NO GREAT SIGNIFICANCE . I BELIEVE THAT THIS MIGHT BE ACCEPTED . I DO NOT LIVE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE FAIRLY WIDELY . \" BUT IF IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO MACMILLAN, AT 69 A LITTLE REMOTE FROM REALITY, IT SHOULD NOT HAVE FOOLED THE OTHERS . \" WE WERE A BUNCH OF NINNIES, \" ADMITS ONE OF THE FIVE PRIVATELY, AND ADDS WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOGIC : \" WE RECALLED THAT EARLIER CASE, IN WHICH \" MY DEAR VASSALL' PROVED TO BE HARMLESS, SO WE WERE BOUND TO FEEL THAT \" DARLING' MIGHT WELL BE SIMILARLY HARMLESS . \" THE EXIT . THE LAST PHASE OF THE CASE BEGAN AFTER PROFUMO PROCLAIMED HIS PURITY TO THE HOUSE, WAS WARMLY PATTED ON THE BACK BY THE PRIME MINISTER, AND WITH HIS WIFE, ACTRESS VALERIE HOBSON, WENT OFF TO THE RACES WITH THE QUEEN MOTHER, AND LATER ATTENDED A TORY BALL AT QUAGLINO'S, A WEST END NIGHTCLUB . BUT THERE WERE EDITORS AND M.P.'S WHO KNEW BY NOW THAT HE HAD LIED, AND PROFUMO SHOWED HIMSELF BOTH ARROGANT AND STUPID IN THINKING THAT HE COULD SUPPRESS THE TRUTH INDEFINITELY BY LIBEL SUITS . (IN FACT, HE SUED PARIS-MATCH FOR LIBEL AND COLLECTED OUT OF COURT FROM ITALY'S TEMPO ILLUSTRATO.) BESIDES, WARD BEGAN TO TALK, AND TO LABOR M.P . GEORGE WIGG HE UNFOLDED A TALE, AS WILSON DESCRIBED IT IN THE COMMONS, THAT \" TOOK THE LID OFF A CORNER OF THE LONDON UNDERWORLD VICE AND DOPE, MARIJUANA, BLACKMAIL AND COUNTER-BLACKMAIL, VIOLENCE, PETTY CRIME . \" ADDED WILSON GRATUITUOUSLY : \" IF WARD'S STATEMENT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AS A FICTION PAPERBACK IN AMERICA, IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED OVERDRAWN AND BEYOND BELIEF . \"  WILSON SENT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WARDWIGG CONVERSATION TO MACMILLAN, WHO TURNED IT OVER TO THE \" APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES, \" WHO FOUND NOTHING DISTURBING IN IT . PRODDED FURTHER, MACMILLAN WROTE WILSON : \" THERE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING IN THE PAPERS YOU SENT WHICH REQUIRES ME TO TAKE ANY ACTION . / WHEN JOHN VASSALL, A HOMOSEXUAL ADMIRALTY CLERK, WAS CONVICTED LAST OCTOBER OF SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS, MACMILLAN SUMMARILY FIRED THE CLERK'S SUPERIOR, THOMAS GALBRAITH, WHO HAD WRITTEN THE CLERK SOME LETTERS STARTING \" MY DEAR VASSALL . \" GALBRAITH WAS LATER WHOLLY EXONERATED . THOUGH POSSIBLY NOT IN BRITAIN, WHERE TROPIC OF CANCER HAS BEEN A BESTSELLER FOR MONTHS AND THE UNEXPURGATED LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER HAS SOLD 3,500,000 PAPERBACK COPIES . EVEN AFTER WARD SENT WILSON, THE HOME SECRETARY AND THE ENTIRE BRITISH PRESS A LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PROFUMO HAD LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE DISCLOSURE \" DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE ANY IMPRESSION \" ON THE PRIME MINISTER . WHILE ORDERING THE LORD CHANCELLOR TO INVESTIGATE WARD'S CHARGES, MACMILLAN ASSURED WILSON HE WAS CONFIDENT NONETHELESS THAT THE SECURITY QUESTION HAD BEEN \" FULLY AND EFFICIENTLY WATCHED \" ALTHOUGH, AS WILSON ACCURATELY POINTED OUT, MI-5 MEN APPARENTLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTINE UNTIL THEY READ ABOUT HER IN THE PAPERS . AS THE DISMAL FACTS AND ALIBIS TUMBLED OUT IN THE COMMONS, THE ADULATION AND AFFECTION THE TORIES HAD ONCE BESTOWED ON \" MACWONDER \" TURNED ALMOST VISIBLY TO A KIND OF STUPEFIED PITY . AT THE END OF HIS DEFENSE, MACMILLAN PLEADED : \" I AM ENTITLED TO THE SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE AND OF THE COUNTRY . \" BUT FROM THE TORY BENCHES, AS HE SAT DOWN, CAME A SOUND THAT WAS MORE SIGH THAN CHEER . BY TWOS AND THREES, PERTURBED BACKBENCHERS WENT OUT TO ARGUE IN THE LOBBIES WHILE SEVERAL TORY SPEAKERS CAUSTICALLY CONDEMNED THE PRIME MINISTER . MACMILLAN ROSE AND WITH BOWED HEAD LEFT THE CHAMBER . WHO NEXT ? SOME ANGRY TORIES FELT THAT MACMILLAN SHOULD RESIGN AT ONCE, BUT AT A BACKBENCHERS' MEETING THE VIEW PREVAILED THAT, AS ONE CABINET MINISTER PUT IT, \" THE COUNTRY MUST NOT GET THE FEELING THAT HE IS BEING HOUNDED OUT BECAUSE OF CHRISTINE KEELER . OUR PARTY WOULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT . \" THE PRESENT CONSENSUS IS THAT MACMILLAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETIRE RATHER THAN TO RESIGN, SOME TIME THIS SUMMER OR FALL . IN PERSPECTIVE, HE MAY WELL REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTERS IN TORY HISTORY, BUT FEW CONSERVATIVES WANT HIM IN COMMAND OF THEIR NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN ; EVEN PREPROFUMO, THE PARTY HAD BEEN IN BAD TROUBLE OVER DEFENSE MUDDLES, BRITAIN'S FAILURE TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET, AND ABOVE ALL MACMILLAN'S STOP-AND-GO FISCAL POLICIES AND A SLUGGISH ECONOMY . ALTHOUGH MACMILLAN HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATED RIVALS BY GIVING THEM THANKLESS TASKS OR SACKING THEM, THE TORIES HAVE A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE SUCCESSORS . CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD (DAILY EXPRESS ODDS : 4-7) IS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING, WHO IS YOUTHFUL (46) AND READY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A PREDICTED ECONOMIC SPURT THIS SUMMER . HE IS ALSO HAPPILY MARRIED, A PARTICULARLY USEFUL QUALIFICATION RIGHT NOW . NEXT ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER \" RAB \" BUTLER (2-1), WHO HAS ALL THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE, BUT AT 60 MAY HAVE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG ; AND LORD HAILSHAM, BELLICOSE, BLIMPISH SCIENCE MINISTER, 55, WHOSE HOPES FADED RAPIDLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT ITS LORDS REFORM BILL, WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO SIT IN THE COMMONS, WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED THIS SUMMER . TED HEATH, 46, IS GENERALLY RULED OUT BECAUSE HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMON MARKET FAILURE, AND BESIDES, HE IS A BACHELOR . WHAT NEXT ? ANY ONE OF THESE TORIES COULD GIVE LABOR A GOOD FIGHT IN THE NEXT ELECTION, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE TO BE HELD TILL THE FALL OF 1964 . BUT LABORITES FEEL THEMSELVES CLOSER TO POWER THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY TIME IN THE LAST DOZEN YEARS . AT WEEK'S END HAROLD WILSON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK IN THE COMMONS, DEMANDING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PROFUMO CASE BY A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE WITH SWEEPOING POWERS . THE MORE LIMITED JUDICIAL INQUIRY PROPOSED BY MACMILLAN, CRIED WILSON, WAS MERELY \" A COVER-UP, \" BECAUSE, WITHOUT AUTHORITY TO COMPEL PROOF OF THE ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES, IT WOULD HAVE TO COLLECT EVIDENCE \" FROM SOME OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED LIARS IN THIS COUNTRY WERE THERE ANY MORE REVELATIONS TO COME WILSON WANTED TO KNOW . NOTHING HE KNEW OF RIGHT NOW, SAID MACMILLAN, BUT HE ADDED : \" I HAVE HEARD TERRIBLE THINGS SAID OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF ALL, CHRISTINE HERSELF, VOLUNTEERED : \" APART FROM THOSE I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IN MY STORY, I DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE NOT MET ANY MINISTERS . \" MACMILLAN RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE . \" THEY HAVE DEEPLY WOUNDED ME, \" HE TOLD A TORY RALLY, ADDING : \" IT WILL NOT BREAK MY SPIRIT . \" BUT THE HOUSE STILL REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF TORY REBEL NIGEL BIRCH, WHO DURING THE BIG DEBATE HAD QUOTED BROWNING'S THE LOST LEADER AT HAROLD MACMILLAN : LET HIM NEVER COME BACK TO US ! THERE WOULD BE DOUBT, HESITATION AND PAIN . FORCED PRAISE ON OUR PART THE GLIMMER OF TWILIGHT, NEVER GLAD CONFIDENT MORNING AGAIN !\n",

OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, ON HIS OWN PEOPLE AND ON THEIR NEIGHBORS, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS PERFECTED HIS NATIVE TALENT FOR HANDING OUT RUDE SURPRISES . EMPLOYING THE LOFTY DISDAIN THAT USED TO INFURIATE ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN, DE GAULLE SUCCEEDED IN INFURIATING KENNEDY, MACMILLAN AND A HOST OF OTHERS BY VETOING BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENTLE ABOUT IT, ALLOWING NEGOTIATIONS TO SPUTTER OUT IN A CONFUSION OF DETAILS . HE CHOSE TO BE BLUNT AND HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO SHUT OUT BRITAIN OR MERELY TO HUMILIATE HER . HE ALSO SHOOK THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE TO ITS ROOTS, SET OUT TO CONTEST ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO PUT IN QUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE U.S . IN EUROPE . FOR THE WEST ! HE CREATED A DRAMATIC HISTORICAL TURN, AN OBSCURE DESTINATION . DEAD MECHANISM . WESTERN EUROPE HEARD THE NEWS WITH ANGER AND DISMAY . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD BLAMED DE GAULLE FOR A \" BLACK DAY, \" DECLARING THAT \" THE COMMON MARKET IS NOW ONLY A MECHANISM AND NO LONGER A LIVING THING . \" ALFRED MULLERARMACK, WEST GERMANY'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR AT BRUSSELS, QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST . JEAN MONNET, THE DYNAMIC OPTIMIST WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE COMMON MARKET, LAMENTED THAT \" THERE NOW LOOMS DISUNION WITH ITS INHERENT DANGERS . \" BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN TOLD HIS COUNTRY ON TV : \" WHAT HAPPENED AT BRUSSELS WAS BAD . BAD FOR US, BAD FOR EUROPE, BAD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD . \" , \" BRUTAL \" WAS THE WORD HEARD MOST OFTEN IN WHITEHALL AND AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO DESCRIBE DE GAULLE'S BEHAVIOR . ARCHITECT OR AT LEAST CO-DESIGNERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, U.S . POLICYMAKERS WERE PLUNGED INTO GLOOM . \" MOST UNFORTUNATE, \" SAID THE STATE DEPARTMENT . IN CONGRESS THERE WERE REVIVED MUTTERINGS ABOUT THE INEFFICACY OF FOREIGN AID AND THE INGRATITUDE OF ALLIES . ARKANSAS' SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT TALKED OF THE \" TEMPORARY ABERRATION \" OF THE MAN . A NATION THAT HAD HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO PROFIT FROM THE COMMUNIST SPLIT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND RED CHINA FOUND A DEEP CREVICE OPENING AT ITS FEET . AND THOUGH THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SPEAK OF AN \" AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL \" OF ITS RELATIONS WITH A RECALCITRANT FRANCE AS JOHN FOSTER DULLES ONCE HAD U.S . MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC POLICY TOWARD EUROPE WAS PLAINLY IN NEED OF ONE . COMMUNITY TWILIGHT . EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN, AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED IN MOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATION OF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILL INEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR \" INNER CONTRADICTIONS . \" CRIED A RUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : \" THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OF STATE . \" NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONE TORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHED HIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20 YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT QUITE THIS WAY . PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE . THAT THEY DID IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 . HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES, SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT, TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE \" GRAND DESIGN, \" IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S . INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE, LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940 HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE \" STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . \" GARGANTUAN STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS . THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST, GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG . BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND 2) HAS \" SPECIAL TIES \" WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950, LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD . / MATTER OF DAYS . \" DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :. THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : \" IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR . THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE \" INSULAR, MARITIME \" BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO \" EUROPEANS \" BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S . WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE \" TROJAN HORSE \" FIRST BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING . NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF BRITAIN, GRUNTED, \" WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . \" A FRENCH DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, \" IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING . \" ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED, AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM . MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION, TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A \"MONSTROUS THING .\" DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED, HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  \"IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS,\" HE DECLARED .  \"IN REALITY, OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN . WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME, NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  \"IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED,\" HE SAID ,\"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT .\"  ADDED HEATH :\"THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS, THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF .\"  WHEN HE STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES, THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED 40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON MARKET (\"FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN,\" SAID A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME . IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT, TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, \"FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY . DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM WITHIN . SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES \"LONELY PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES .\" WHAT DISTURBS MANY AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS . DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE \"BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET .\" SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK, AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV, WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY . THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE TOLD AN AIDE, \" NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST PUSH IN EUROPE . \" THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE, AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, \" REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . \" ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST . HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN EUROPE, THE GRADUAL \" BOURGEOISATION \" OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES, WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, \" STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS . \" HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE . NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . \" AND, HE ARGUES, \" IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE . \" IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S . NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . \" I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE, BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . \" IN EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP . IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE \" COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE FREE WORLD . \" IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, \" THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . \" THE SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY . . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?\n",

      "     Preview: GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY ? SHOUTED THE DAILY MIRROR . AS IF ANYONE DIDN'T KNOW . WHAT WENT ON WAS JUST THE KIND OF STORY ON WHICH THE MIRROR THRIVES . ALTHOUGH IT HAD STARTED OUT MERELY AS VENERY IN HIGH (AND SEVERAL LOW) PLACES, IT GREW INTO A MAJOR SCANDAL THAT NOT ONLY SMASHED THE CAREER OF A PROMISING TORY POLITICIAN, BUT ALSO RAISED SOME TROUBLING QUESTIONS ABOUT BRITISH SECURITY AND ROCKED THE MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT . OTHERWISE, IT READ LIKE LA DOLCE VITA, ANGLO-SAXON STYLE . THE STORY FIRST EMERGED PARTIALLY LAST MARCH, WHEN ITS LEADING CHARACTERS BECAME PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED : RED-HAIRED CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO CAME FROM MIDDLESEX TO SLING HASH AT 17, AND AT 21 WAS THE WEST END'S MOST-CALLED GIRL ; JOHN PROFUMO, 48, THE ABLE WAR MINISTER AND MAN-ABOUT-MAYFAIR, WHOSE VIRILE CHARM PROVED SOMETHING OF A TORY ASSET AFTER THOSE HOMOSEXUAL SPY SCANDALS ,; AND DR . STEPHEN WARD, 43, A SOCIAL OSTEOPATH (AND SON OF THE ANGLICAN CANON OF ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL), WHO SAID HE LIKED HELPING ATTRACTIVE GIRLS OF HUMBLE BIRTH ADAPT TO \" THE NEEDS AND STRESSES OF MODERN LIVING . \" AFTER MONTHS OF RUMOR, A LABOR M.P . CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT TO DENY THE RUMORS OF A MINISTER'S INDISCRETIONS WITH CHRISTINE . PROFUMO'S FIRM DENIAL OF WRONGDOING, AND A DEMONSTRATION OF SUPPORT FROM PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN, QUASHED THE STORY TEMPORARILY UNTIL IT BURST FORTH AGAIN LAST WEEK . THIS TIME PROFUMO RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AFTER AN ABRUPT, ABJECT CONFESSION THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIED TO THE PRIME MINISTER, HIS COLLEAGUES AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS . COEXISTENCE . OF NOBLE ITALIAN DESCENT, JOHN DENNIS PROFUMO HAD EVERY QUALIFICATION TO REACH THE TORIES' TOP RANKS : HARROW AND OXFORD, FINE WAR RECORD, BRAINS, DRIVE, AND A BEAUTIFUL WIFE, MOVIE ACTRESS VALERIE (GREAT EXPECTATIONS) HOBSON . TOGETHER, THE PROFUMOS WERE WEEKENDING AT CLIVEDEN, FAMED COUNTRY ESTATE OF LORD AND LADY ASTOR, WHEN THEY WERE INTRODUCED TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 . ALSO PRESENT : STEPHEN WARD, WHO HAD A COTTAGE ON THE PLACE . THEREAFTER, VALERIE STAYED HOME WHILE JACK VISITED CHRISTINE AT WARD'S FLAT IN WIMPOLE MEWS . WHAT THE WAR MINISTER NEVER KNEW WAS THAT CHRISTINE HAD ANOTHER REGULAR VISITOR, EVGENY IVANOV, WHO WAS A SOVIET NAVAL ATTACHE IN LONDON . A ROUND-EYED OBSERVER OF THEIR COEXISTENCE WAS NYMPHET MARILYN ( \" MANDY \" ) RICE-DAVIES, A WELL-DEVELOPED 16-YEAR-OLD, WHO WAS ONE OF CHRISTINE'S INTIMATES . \" THE FARCICAL THING ABOUT IT ALL, \" AS MANDY TOLD THE PRESS, \" WAS THAT, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, AS JACK LEFT CHRISTINE AT THE FLAT, IVANOV WALKED IN . \" IT POSSIBLY SEEMED LESS HILARIOUS TO BRITISH MI-5 INTELLIGENCE AGENTS, WHO WERE SHADOWING IVANOV AT THE TIME, TO FIND THAT THEIR WAR MINISTER WAS UNWITTINGLY SHARING A BED WITH A SUSPECTED SOVIET SPY . THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE THOUGH THEY TRIED NOT TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC, PROFUMO SOMETIMES TOOK CHRISTINE FOR DRIVES, SHE LATER RECALLED . \" HE SHOWED ME THE WAR OFFICE, WHERE HE WORKED . HE EVEN SHOWED ME DOWNING STREET . \" BUT IN TIME PROFUMO STOPPED SEEING CHRISTINE BECAUSE, SHE EXPLAINED, HE WAS \" SCARED IT WOULD RUIN HIS CAREER . \" COMRADE IVANOV WAS SHIPPED OFF TO MOSCOW, AND THE \" MODEL \" FROM MIDDLESEX, WHO HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR JAZZ ON THE WAY UP, HIT THE BLUES BELT AND ACQUIRED A JAMAICAN LOVER NAMED JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE . BUT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HER TELEPHONE WAS FOR . \" HE SEEMED TO THINK, \" CHRISTINE COMPLAINED LATER, \" THAT I WAS GOING TO LIVE WITH HIM FOREVER . \" ONE DAY, JOHNNIE SHOWED UP WITH A GUN AND FIRED SEVERAL BULLETS INTO THE DOOR BEFORE THE BOBBIES BAGGED HIM . MULTIRACIALISM . AFTER JOHNNIE WENT TO JAIL, THERE WAS ANOTHER WEST INDIAN LOVER, ALOYSIUS \" LUCKY \" GORDON, WHO, IF ANYTHING, WAS EVEN MORE NARROWMINDED . IN APRIL HE BEAT HER UP . LAST WEEK, AT HIS TRIAL FOR ASSAULT, ALOYSIUS WAS SO UNGALLANT AS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAD KEPT HER SUPPLIED WITH MARIJUANA, WHILE ALL SHE GAVE HIM IN RETURN WAS VD . \" YOU CAN SAY THIS FOR CHRISTINE, \" SAID A LEADING LABOR POLITICIAN . \" AT LEAST SHE'S MULTIRACIAL . \" THE SCANDAL MIGHT HAVE DIED, HAD IT NOT BEEN RESURRECTED BY STEPHEN WARD HIMSELF . SEVEN WEEKS AFTER PROFUMO'S DENIAL, HE TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE SECRETARY THAT THE WAR MINISTER HAD LIED IN COMMONS, THAT HE HAD INDEED HAD AN AFFAIR WITH CHRISTINE KEELER . WARD REPEATED HIS CHARGES IN LETTERS TO HOME SECRETARY HENRY BROOKE AND LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON . PROFUMO WAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS NEW ACCUSATION, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT HE STARTLED TORY OFFICIALS BY BLURTING THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTINE IN A LETTER TO THE VACATIONING PRIME MINISTER, PROFUMO RESIGNED AS WAR MINISTER AND AS M.P . FOR STRATFORD-ON-AVON, CONFESSING HIS \" GRAVE MISDEMEANOR . \" SAID HE : \" I CANNOT TELL YOU OF MY DEEP REMORSE . \" MACMILLAN ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION, DESCRIBING THE AFFAIR AS \" A GREAT TRAGEDY . \" THEN PROFUMO AND HIS WIFE LEFT THEIR REGENT'S PARK HOME AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE COUNTRY . DILEMMA . THE SCANDAL HE LEFT BEHIND GOT LIVELIER EVERY DAY . CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO WAS BACK FROM A CONTINENTAL HOLIDAY AND SUDDENLY SPORTED A \" BUSINESS MANAGER \" AND A NEW ROLLS-ROYCE, ADDED MORE OFF-COLOR TO THE SAGA BY TELLING AND SELLING HER STORY TO THE PAPERS . \" I WAS VERY FOND OF JACK, \" SHE SAID WISTFULLY . \" IF EVER WE MEET AGAIN, WE HAVE AT LEAST THIS IN COMMON BOTH OUR CAREERS HAVE BEEN RUINED . \" MANDY CHIMED IN WITH DETAILS OF THE HIGH LIVING THAT HAD EARNED HER A JAGUAR, MINK AND DIAMONDS BY HER 17TH BIRTHDAY . AT ONE DINNER PARTY, SHE RECALLED, \" A NAKED MAN WEARING A MASK WAITED ON TABLE LIKE A SLAVE . HE HAD TO HAVE A MASK BECAUSE HE WAS SO WELL KNOWN . / MEANWHILE STEPHEN WARD'S EXPLANATIONS FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS AND TV SCREENS . THE AFFAIR, HE PROTESTED, HAD GIVEN RISE TO \" A WHOLE TRAIN OF RUMORS, AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WERE MENTIONED, WITH THE IMPLICATION THAT I'D BEEN TRYING TO PROCURE THEM FOR MISS KEELER . \" DESPITE HIS SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO PROTECT PROFUMO AND THE GOVERNMENT, SAID WARD, HE HAD REPORTED PROFUMO'S LIAISON TO BRITISH INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT IN 1961 . SAID HE : \" I'VE ALMOST HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN . IT'S A TERRIBLE DILEMMA . ONE DIDN'T WANT TO BITCH UP ANYBODY . YOU OWE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS . BUT I MUST CLEAR MYSELF . \" FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, STEPHEN WARD WILL DO HIS EXPLAINING IN COURT . AT WEEK'S END SCOTLAND YARD PLUCKED THE OSTEOPATH FROM HIS WHITE JAGUAR SPORTS CAR AND JAILED HIM ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING BRITAIN'S SEXUAL OFFENSES ACT BY / LIVING WHOLLY OR IN PART ON THE EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTION . \" UNREST . AS A MATTER OF POLITICAL TACTICS, THE LABOR PARTY DECIDED TO TREAT THE PROFUMO AFFAIR NOT SO MUCH AS A MORAL INDICTMENT OF UPPERCRUST BRITAIN BUT RATHER AS ANOTHER FLAGRANT EXAMPLE OF THE ERRATIC WORKINGS OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM . IF, ARGUED LABORITES, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT BRITAIN'S WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED A CALL GIRL WITH A SOVIET AGENT, WHY WAS NOTHING DONE TO BREAK UP A LIAISON THAT MIGHT EXPOSE HIM TO RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL ? WAS MACMILLAN TOLD ? IF SO, HAD THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED PROFUMO TO LIE ABOUT HIS DALLIANCE WITH CHRISTINE KEELER SOLELY IN ORDER TO AVERT A DAMAGING SCANDAL ? UNFLAPPABLE HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO DID NOT ALLOW LAST WEEK'S EVENTS TO INTERRUPT HIS GOLFING VACATION, WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE WHEN PARLIAMENT RECONVENES NEXT WEEK . HE MAY YET, AS IN THE PAST, CONFOUND HIS CRITICS IN COMMONS . BUT THE AFFAIR MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE TORIES' ALREADY SHAKY CHANCES AT THE NEXT ELECTIONS, WHICH MACMILLAN WILL NOW PROBABLY TRY TO DELAY . SAID TORY BACKBENCHER LORD LAMBTON : \" THE HARM THIS WILL DO TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL BE ENORMOUS . THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME A GENERAL FEELING OF UNREST IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO THE MORALITY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT . THIS FEELING WILL BE IMMENSELY INCREASED . /\n",

THANKS TO WASHINGTON'S SUCCESS IN SELLING MLF TO GERMANY AND THEN TO ITALY, IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS IF THE FLEET MIGHT BE BUILT WITH ONLY A TOKEN CONTRIBUTION FROM BRITAIN .

IN COPENHAGEN LAST WEEK, AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE, KRAG FACED HIS SUPREME POLITICAL TEST WHEN HE INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT A COMPLEX SERIES OF MEASURES THAT WILL 1) EXTEND ALL UNION CONTRACTS FOR TWO YEARS, THUS LIMITING WAGE INCREASES ; 2) FIX MAXIMUM PRICES OF ALL CONSUMER GOODS EXCEPT FISH AND FARM PRODUCTS ; AND 3) COMPEL ALL TAXPAYERS TO BUY UP TO $290 IN 4 PER CENT BONDS THAT CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR FIVE YEARS . A TRAINED ECONOMIST, KRAG INSISTED THAT HIS DRACONIAN MEASURES ARE ESSENTIAL ; MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION IN EUROPE, DENMARK HAD STAKED ITS ECONOMIC FUTURE ON JOINING THE COMMON MARKET ALONG WITH BRITAIN . WHEN DE GAULLE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP, FRANCE'S PRESIDENT SHREWDLY PROMISED DENMARK IMMEDIATE ADMISSION . KRAG'S REPLY WAS SHARP AND TO THE POINT : \" WE HAVE NO WISH TO BE ONE OF PRESIDENT DE GAULLE'S PIECES IN THE POLITICAL CHESS GAME WITH BRITAIN . IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR TWO MAJOR CUSTOMERS, BRITAIN AND WEST GERMANY, INSIDE THE SAME ORGANIZATION . IT MUST BE OUR PURPOSE IN ALL FIELDS TO SEE THAT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A UNIFIED EUROPE GO ON . \" BUT KRAG'S LOYALTY TO HIS FRIENDS ABROAD HARDLY ALLAYED HIS HEADACHES AT HOME . RACKED BY SEVERE INFLATION, DENMARK LAST YEAR SAW ITS TRADE DEFICIT DANGEROUSLY INCREASED TO $486 MILLION, WHILE ITS CURRENCY RESERVES WERE CUT IN HALF . IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, DANISH WAGES HAVE RISEN 40 PER CENT , PRODUCTION LESS THAN 20 PER CENT . THE STRINGENT NEW ECONOMIC PROGRAM DREW ANGUISHED CRIES FROM EMPLOYERS AND THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION, BUT KRAG CURTLY REJECTED THE TRADITIONAL DANISH COMPROMISE . KRAG'S COALITION GOVERNMENT CAN UNDOUBTEDLY SQUEEZE THE BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT BY ITS USUAL ONE-VOTE MAJORITY, AND THE DANES WILL HAVE TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS FOR YEARS OF AUSTERITY AHEAD .\n",

YET WHO SHOULD BE SERVING UP LEMONADE LAST WEEK THAN THAT OLD REALIST NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV . IN THE KREMLIN'S MARBLE-HALLED PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES, ADDRESSING THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND MORE THAN 5,000 OTHER COMRADES, NIKITA PROMISED THAT ONE GREAT FORCE WOULD MIRACULOUSLY STRAIGHTEN OUT THE SOVIET ECONOMIC MESS : BIG CHEMISTRY . BETWEEN 1964 AND 1970, KHRUSHCHEV ANNOUNCED, THE REGIME WILL SPEND $46 BILLION TO EXPAND THE SOVIET CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT THAT NOW GOES ANNUALLY INTO ALL DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT . WHERE WOULD THE ADDITIONAL MONEY COME FROM ? KHRUSHCHEV HINTED AT A RADICAL REDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING . MORE IMPORTANT, HE ADMITTED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NEED CREDIT AND SUPPLIES, INCLUDING ENTIRE FACTORIES, FROM THE WEST BUT NOT, HE FUMED, AT \" FABULOUS PROFITS \" TO THE CAPITALISTS . BRAVE TALK . PLANS CALL FOR BUILDING 200 NEW PLANTS AND MODERNIZING 500 OLD ONES ; SINCE MUCH OF THE NEW PRODUCTION WILL BE PLASTICS AND SYNTHETIC FIBERS, SOVIET CITIZENS MAY AT LAST FIND IT EASIER TO BUY SUCH SIMPLE ITEMS AS NYLON STOCKINGS AND LINOLEUM FLOORING . \" FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALL THE 46 YEARS OF SOVIET POWER, \" SAID NIKITA IN A REMARKABLE CONFESSION, THE PARTY AND THE STATE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT \" SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PEOPLE . \" MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS MUST SHOW BETTER DESIGN, BECAUSE IT IS \" NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO TOLERATE \" RUSSIAN CONSUMER GOODS THAT \" LOOK LESS SMART THAN FOREIGN ARTICLES . \" AN EVEN MORE URGENT TASK FOR BIG CHEMISTRY IS THE PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZER . ITS OUTPUT, PROMISED KHRUSHCHEV, WOULD BE QUADRUPLED FROM 20 MILLION TONS THIS YEAR TO 80 MILLION TONS BY 1970 . THIS WOULD PERMIT RUSSIA TO CATCH UP WITH THE U.S., FOR U.S . FARM SURPLUSES ARE NOT THE RESULT OF ANY \" SPECIAL AMERICAN WISDOM, \" KHRUSHCHEV INSISTED ; IT IS JUST THAT THE U.S . USES ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH FERTILIZER AS THE SOVIET UNION ON ABOUT HALF THE ACREAGE . THROUGH ALL THIS BRAVE TALK RAN THE ADMISSION OF RUSSIA'S DISASTROUS AGRICULTURAL FAILURES . ONE ARRESTING FIGURE : ALTHOUGH ACREAGE INCREASED 7 PER CENT SINCE LAST YEAR, YIELD ACTUALLY DROPPED 20 PER CENT . IF ANYONE WAS INCLINED TO CRITICIZE THIS FAILURE, OR THE COSTLY PALLIATIVE OF BUYING GRAIN FROM THE WEST, KHRUSHCHEV HAD THE STANDARD ANSWER . REMEMBER HOW BAD THINGS WERE UNDER STALIN . IN 1947, TO EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, STALIN AND MOLOTOV ACTUALLY SOLD GRAIN ABROAD WHILE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS \" PEOPLE HAD BLOATED STOMACHS OR EVEN DIED FROM LACK OF FOOD . \" IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MOSCOW HAD ADMITTED THAT STARVATION TOOK PLACE IN THE SOVIET UNION SINCE THE FORCED COLLECTIVIZATION OF THE EARLY 1930S . BULGING WAREHOUSES . FOLLOWING KHRUSHCHEV'S 4F-HOUR SPEECH, OTHER COMMUNIST BIGWIGS SHOOK THE AUDIENCE WITH A SERIES OF ANGRY COMPLAINTS . MOST COLLECTIVE FARMERS DO NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT USING CHEMICAL FERTILIZER ; THE UKRAINE IS PLANNING A CRASH PROGRAM TO EDUCATE 4,000 / SKILLED FERTILIZER APPLIERS . \" SUPERPHOSPHATE FERTILIZER ARRIVES AT THE FARMS WITH ONLY 20 PER CENT OF THE REQUIRED CHEMICAL NUTRIENTS ; THE REST IS WORTHLESS BALLAST THAT GETS LUMPY AND HEAVY IN THE RAIN . RUSSIA HAS AN IMPRESSIVE 561 SOIL LABORATORIES, BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE ONLY ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES AND THE WRONG EQUIPMENT . AS FOR THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ITSELF, MANAGERS ARE STILL WAITING FOR DELIVERY OF EQUIPMENT DESIGNED TEN YEARS AGO . SOME OF THE PRODUCTS ARE SO UNGAINLY THAT THEY PILE UP UNSOLD IN WAREHOUSES FOR INSTANCE, SYNTHETIC FUR COATS, WHICH, COMPLAINED ONE SPEAKER, \" ARE SO HEAVY THAT ONLY WELL-TRAINED ATHLETES CAN WEAR THEM . \" ONLY ABOUT 30 PER CENT OF THE WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE ENGAGED IN PRODUCTION, WHILE THE REST ARE OCCUPIED WITH MAINTENANCE OR BUREAUCRATIC TASKS . MOREOVER, WORKERS ARE UNDERPAID AND RECEIVE ONLY A FRACTION OF THE PRESCRIBED INCENTIVE BONUSES . THE MATTER OF PERSONAL INCENTIVES WAS CLEARLY THE KEY TO THE SITUATION, BOTH IN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE . IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF COLLECTIVE FARMING NOT THE RELATIVELY SUPERFICIAL PROBLEM OF FERTILIZER PRODUCTION THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE CHRONIC CRISIS . AS KHRUSHCHEV'S OWN FIGURES SHOWED, PEASANTS WORKING ON THEIR TINY, PRIVATE HALF-ACRE PLOTS, WHICH COMPRISE LESS THAN 1 PER CENT OF THE ARABLE LAND, SELL TO THE STATE 14 PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY'S MEAT, 30 PER CENT OF THE EGGS, AND RAISE 65 PER CENT OF THE CABBAGES AND POTATOES .\n",

LAST WEEK, HAVING STOOD FRANCE'S FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ON THEIR EARS, DE GAULLE TRIUMPHANTLY SURVEYED THE SCENE FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOME 120 NEWLY ELECTED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTIES IN A RECEPTION AT ELYSEE PALACE . DE GAULLE, WHOSE ATTITUDE TOWARD ECONOMICS IS VAGUE AT BEST, LOFTILY EXPLAINED TO THE DEPUTIES WHY THE U.S . WANTED BRITAIN IN THE COMMON MARKET : \" THE AMERICANS ARE GIVING AWAY THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE SOUTH AMERICANS, THE AFRICANS, AND EVEN THE ARABS . THEREFORE THEY MUST TRY TO SELL THEM IN EUROPE, WHICH CAN PAY FOR THEM . \" THIS WAS WILDLY INACCURATE : U.S .

SHRUGGING THAT THIS \" NATURALLY CHANGED THE TONE \" OF THE JAN . 14 PRESS CONFERENCE AT WHICH DE GAULLE GUTTED BRITAIN'S HOPES OF JOINING EUROPE, DE GAULLE ADDED TESTILY : \" MR .

HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT QUITE THIS WAY . PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE . THAT THEY DID IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 . HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES, SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT, TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE \" GRAND DESIGN, \" IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S . INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE, LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940 HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE \" STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . \" GARGANTUAN STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS . THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST, GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG . BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND 2) HAS \" SPECIAL TIES \" WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950, LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD . / MATTER OF DAYS . \" DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :. THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : \" IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR . THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE \" INSULAR, MARITIME \" BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO \" EUROPEANS \" BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S . WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE \" TROJAN HORSE \" FIRST BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING . NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF BRITAIN, GRUNTED, \" WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . \" A FRENCH DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, \" IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING . \" ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED, AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM . MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION, TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A \"MONSTROUS THING .\" DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED, HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  \"IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS,\" HE DECLARED .  \"IN REALITY, OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN . WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME, NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  \"IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED,\" HE SAID ,\"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT .\"  ADDED HEATH :\"THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS, THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF .\"  WHEN HE STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES, THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED 40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON MARKET (\"FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN,\" SAID A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME . IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT, TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, \"FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY . DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM WITHIN . SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES \"LONELY PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES .\" WHAT DISTURBS MANY AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS . DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE \"BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET .\" SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK, AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV, WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY . THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE TOLD AN AIDE, \" NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST PUSH IN EUROPE . \" THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE, AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, \" REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . \" ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST . HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN EUROPE, THE GRADUAL \" BOURGEOISATION \" OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES, WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, \" STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS . \" HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE . NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . \" AND, HE ARGUES, \" IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE . \" IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S . NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . \" I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE, BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . \" IN EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP . IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE \" COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE FREE WORLD . \" IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, \" THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . \" THE SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY . . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?\n",

      "     Preview: CLOCK TICKED TOWARD STARTING TIME FOR THE GREAT DEBATE, THERE WERE ONLY TWO EMPTY SEATS IN THE JAMMED, EXPECTANT CHAMBER . THE FIRST WAS FILLED, WITH FOUR MINUTES TO SPARE, BY HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO SAT DOWN STIFFLY ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH, LOOKING AS CHILL AND WAN AS HIS EFFIGY AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S . TWO MINUTES LATER, A SHORT, PLUMP MAN IN A SHABBY GREY SUIT BUSTLED EXPRESSIONLESSLY DOWN THE GANGWAY, SANK INTO THE OPPOSITION FRONT BENCH FACING MACMILLAN, AND FINGERED A CARDBOARD FILE . AS THE CLOCK STRUCK, LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON ROSE TO HIS FEET AND FOR A SECOND SAVORED THE TINGLING SILENCE BEFORE BREAKING IT WITH HIS FLAT NASAL YORKSHIRE VOICE . \" THIS IS A DEBATE, \" HE BEGAN, \" WITHOUT PRECEDENCE IN THE ANNALS OF THE HOUSE . \" THE TWO MEN WERE THE PRODUCTS OF TWO REMARKABLE POLITICAL CAREERS AND ALSO OF TWO BRITAINS : MACMILLAN, THE SKILLFUL, COURAGEOUS AND OFTEN RUTHLESS PATRICIAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIS COUNTRY FROM THE DEBRIS OF SUEZ AND LED IT INTO AN ERA OF UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY ; HAROLD WILSON, THE DRY, DILIGENT AND OFTEN DEVIOUS SON OF A PROVINCIAL CHEMIST WHO HAD RISEN BY HARD WORK AND CHANCE (INCLUDING THE DEATH OF THE MAN HE SUCCEEDED, HUGH GAITSKELL) TO THE TOP OF THE LABOR PARTY . AS HE FACED MACMILLAN, WHO HAD GONE TO OXFORD BY FAMILY TRADITION, HAROLD WILSON, WHO HAD GONE TO OXFORD ON A SCHOLARSHIP, STROVE TO EMBODY A NEW, IMPATIENT, CLASS-DEFYING ENGLAND . THE MORAL DECAY SURROUNDING THE PROFUMO AFFAIR, HE TRIED HARD TO SUGGEST, MUST BE BLAMED ON THE TORIES . REFERRING TO CHRISTINE KEELER'S REPORTED $14,000-A-WEEK NIGHTCLUB CONTRACT, WILSON DECLARED : \" THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY NAUSEATING ABOUT A SYSTEM OF SOCIETY WHICH PAYS A HARLOT 25 TIMES AS MUCH AS IT PAYS ITS PRIME MINISTER . \" FOR THE REST, HAROLD WILSON STUCK TO THE SECURITY ISSUE AND THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE PROFUMO CASE, WHICH HE ATTACKED AS EITHER DISHONEST OR INCOMPETENT, OR BOTH . LET DOWN . THE ONCE UNFLAPPABLE MACMILLAN FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT AND KEPT DABBING AT THE POUCHES BENEATH HIS EYES WITH A CRUMPLED HANDKERCHIEF . WHEN HE ROSE, HE OPENLY PLAYED FOR THE SYMPATHY OF HIS COLLEAGUES . \" WHAT HAS HAPPENED, \" HE SAID, \" HAS INFLICTED A DEEP, BITTER AND LASTING WOUND ON ME . \" ESSENTIALLY HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN GROSSLY DECEIVED BY PROFUMO AN \" ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE \" CULPRIT AND BADLY LET DOWN BY HIS SUBORDINATES, WHO FAILED TO KEEP HIM INFORMED . FROM THE BACK BENCHES CAME A RUDE GIBE OF \" NOBODY EVER TELLS ME NUFFIN ! \" BY THE TIME MACMILLAN FINISHED, THE HOUSE WAS PREPARED TO ACQUIT HIM OF PERSONAL DISHONESTY AND MORAL TURPITUDE, BUT HE HAD CONVICTED HIMSELF OF NEGLIGENCE AND NAIVETE OR PERHAPS SIMPLY OF A FATAL ABILITY TO AVERT HIS EYES FROM WHAT HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE . IN THE VOTE FOLLOWING THE DEBATE, 27 CONSERVATIVES VOTED AGAINST MACMILLAN OR ABSTAINED . ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE CRIES OF \" RESIGN, RESIGN, \" AND THIS IS WHAT MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO THE ONLY REMAINING QUESTION BEING WHEN . THE WARNING . THE LONG DEBATE SERVED TO FIX GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY, OR THE LACK OF IT, AND ILLUSTRATED THE ODD NATURE OF THE BRITISH SECURITY SYSTEM, COMPOUNDED OF SHREWDNESS, INEFFICIENCY, AND AN OFTEN MISGUIDED SENSE OF SPORTSMANSHIP THAT GOES TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS IN PROTECTING MEMBERS OF THE CLUB . THE CASE, AS IT EMERGED FROM THE DEBATE, FALLS INTO FOUR PHASES . FIRST, THERE WAS THE CHRISTINE-PROFUMO AFFAIR ITSELF, WHICH, ACCORDING TO PROFUMO, LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS, FROM JULY TO DECEMBER 1961, BUT BY OTHER EVIDENCE POSSIBLY LASTED LONGER . DURING THOSE SAME MONTHS, CHRISTINE ALSO ENTERTAINED RUSSIAN ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV, WHO HAD BEEN PALS FOR SOME TIME WITH HER MENTOR, DR . STEPHEN WARD . MI-5, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE, APPARENTLY DISCOVERED ONLY HALF OF WHAT WILSON SCATHINGLY CALLED \" THIS DINGY QUADRILATERAL . \" IN AUGUST 1961, ACCORDING TO THE COMMONS DEBATE, CABINET SECRETARY SIR NORMAN BROOK WARNED PROFUMO THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE SECRETARY FOR WAR NOT TO BE TOO FRIENDLY WITH WARD ; HE DID NOT MENTION, AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, CHRISTINE . NOTHING OF THIS WAS REPORTED TO MACMILLAN . IN THE SECOND PHASE, WHICH COVERS MOST OF 1962, RUMORS OF THE AFFAIR KEPT REACHING THE NEWSPAPERS, TORY AND LABOR POLITICIANS, BUT APPARENTLY NOT THE PRIME MINISTER . DURING THE CUBA BLOWUP, WARD WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, SUGGESTING TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE THAT HIS FRIEND IVANOV BE USED AS AN INTERMEDIARY TO HELP SETTLE THE CRISIS . BUT SAID MACMILLAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE THEN TRYING TO GET INTO THE ACT \" TO WEAKEN OUR RESOLUTION . \" A LITTLE LATER, WILSON HIMSELF GOT A LETTER FROM WARD, BOASTING OF HIS SUPPOSED HELP IN SETTLING THE CUBA MATTER, BUT FILED IT AWAY AS COMING FROM A CRANK . BEFORE IVANOV WAS RECALLED TO MOSCOW IN JANUARY 1963, HE AROUSED SUSPICION IN OTHER WAYS . A BRIDGE PLAYER WHO TOOK A HAND IN SOME VERY HIGH-LEVEL GAMES, HE LOST STEADILY, AS MUCH AS $140 A NIGHT . \" I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S PETTY CASH WOULD STAND SUCH LOSSES EVERY NIGHT, \" SAID ONE LABOR M.P . CAUSTICALLY, / UNLESS THEY GOT SOMETHING FOR IT . \" THE VIGIL . IN THE THIRD AND MOST REMARKABLE PHASE, MACMILLAN FINALLY BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A PROFUMO CASE . IN JANUARY 1963, AS MACMILLAN TOLD COMMONS POLICE LEARNED FROM CHRISTINE THAT WARD HAD ASKED HER TO FIND OUT FROM PROFUMO WHEN THE U.S . WAS TO DELIVER CERTAIN NUCLEAR INFORMATION AND WARHEADS TO WEST GERMANY (SHE SAID THAT SHE REFUSED TO DO IT) . MACMILLAN WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS EITHER . BUT WHILE HE WAS AWAY IN ITALY, THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HUGE (CIRC . 6,500,000) NEWS OF THE WORLD REPORTED THE PROFUMO RUMORS TO MACMILLAN'S PRINCIPAL PRIVATE SECRETARY . CONFRONTED WITH THE STORY, PROFUMO DENIED EVERYTHING TO SEVERAL OFFICIALS ; THE RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN INNOCENT, HE SAID, AND ANYWAY HAD ENDED LONG BEFORE . WHY DIDN'T THE PRIME MINISTER QUESTION PROFUMO HIMSELF AT ANY TIME ? MACMILLAN'S LAME ANSWER : HE ASSUMED THAT PROFUMO WOULD SPEAK MORE FREELY TO OTHERS, AND FURTHERMORE SUCH AN INTERROGATION WOULD HAVE MADE \" SOCIAL RELATIONS \" BETWEEN HIMSELF AND PROFUMO HIGHLY EMBARRASSING . AND WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ATTEMPT TO INTERROGATE CHRISTINE HERSELF TO CHECK OUT PROFUMO'S DENIAL ? TO THIS, MACMILLAN HAD NO ANSWER AT ALL . AFTER CHRISTINE FAILED TO APPEAR AS A WITNESS LAST MARCH IN THE TRIAL OF A JEALOUS NEGRO LOVER WHO HAD TRIED TO SHOOT HER, QUESTIONS WERE FINALLY RAISED IN PARLIAMENT . MACMILLAN ASKED FOR ACTION, ADMITTEDLY HOPING FOR A STATEMENT FROM PROFUMO THAT WOULD QUELL FURTHER RUMORS IN THE PRESS THROUGH FEAR OF LIBEL . WHEN THE HOUSE ADJOURNED AFTER MIDNIGHT, PROFUMO WAS AWAKENED, AND AT 1 : 30 A.M . CAME TO CHIEF TORY WHIP MARTIN REDMAYNE'S COMMONS OFFICE WITH HIS SOLICITOR . HE WAS CONFRONTED BY REDMAYNE, TORY CHAIRMAN IAIN MACLEOD, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO WILLIAM DEEDES, ATTORNEY GENERAL SIR JOHN HOBSON AND SOLICITOR GENERAL SIR PETER RAWLINSON . TWO OF PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS HAD BEEN AT HARROW WITH HIM . WHERE LAST WEEK HE WAS EXPELLED FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DISMISSED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, AND SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL . THE LETTER . UNDER FRIENDLY QUESTIONING UNTIL 5 A.M., PROFUMO DENIED MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE . HE AGREED TO MAKE A SACROSANCT \" PERSONAL STATEMENT, \" ASSURING THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED \" NO IMPROPRIETY WHATSOEVER \" WITH MISS KEELER . HIS FELLOW MINISTERS SUGGESTED THAT HE ADMIT AT LEAST TO BEING \" ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH HER, \" ALTHOUGH IT \" SOUNDED SO AWFUL, \" AS PROFUMO PUT IT . \" WE INSISTED THAT IT MUST BE INCLUDED, \" EXPLAINED MACLEOD FATUOUSLY LAST WEEK, \" BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE TRUTH . \" AGAINST HIMSELF AND THE FOUR OTHER MINISTERS, MACLEOD ADDED, \" TWO POSSIBLE CHARGES CAN BE BROUGHT . FIRST, THAT WE WERE CONSPIRING KNAVES, AND SECONDLY, THAT WE WERE GULLIBLE FOOLS . \" THEY WERE INDEED GULLIBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WANTED TO BE . EVEN THE MOST CURSORY CHECKING WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THAT WHILE CHRISTINE MAY HAVE HAD JOIE DE VIVRE, SHE HAD LITTLE DISCRETION . PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS KNEW BY THEN ABOUT A LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 BEGINNING \" DARLING . . . \" PROFUMO EXPLAINED, AS MACMILLAN PUT IT, THAT IN HIS CIRCLES \" IT WAS A TERM OF NO GREAT SIGNIFICANCE . I BELIEVE THAT THIS MIGHT BE ACCEPTED . I DO NOT LIVE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE FAIRLY WIDELY . \" BUT IF IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO MACMILLAN, AT 69 A LITTLE REMOTE FROM REALITY, IT SHOULD NOT HAVE FOOLED THE OTHERS . \" WE WERE A BUNCH OF NINNIES, \" ADMITS ONE OF THE FIVE PRIVATELY, AND ADDS WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOGIC : \" WE RECALLED THAT EARLIER CASE, IN WHICH \" MY DEAR VASSALL' PROVED TO BE HARMLESS, SO WE WERE BOUND TO FEEL THAT \" DARLING' MIGHT WELL BE SIMILARLY HARMLESS . \" THE EXIT . THE LAST PHASE OF THE CASE BEGAN AFTER PROFUMO PROCLAIMED HIS PURITY TO THE HOUSE, WAS WARMLY PATTED ON THE BACK BY THE PRIME MINISTER, AND WITH HIS WIFE, ACTRESS VALERIE HOBSON, WENT OFF TO THE RACES WITH THE QUEEN MOTHER, AND LATER ATTENDED A TORY BALL AT QUAGLINO'S, A WEST END NIGHTCLUB . BUT THERE WERE EDITORS AND M.P.'S WHO KNEW BY NOW THAT HE HAD LIED, AND PROFUMO SHOWED HIMSELF BOTH ARROGANT AND STUPID IN THINKING THAT HE COULD SUPPRESS THE TRUTH INDEFINITELY BY LIBEL SUITS . (IN FACT, HE SUED PARIS-MATCH FOR LIBEL AND COLLECTED OUT OF COURT FROM ITALY'S TEMPO ILLUSTRATO.) BESIDES, WARD BEGAN TO TALK, AND TO LABOR M.P . GEORGE WIGG HE UNFOLDED A TALE, AS WILSON DESCRIBED IT IN THE COMMONS, THAT \" TOOK THE LID OFF A CORNER OF THE LONDON UNDERWORLD VICE AND DOPE, MARIJUANA, BLACKMAIL AND COUNTER-BLACKMAIL, VIOLENCE, PETTY CRIME . \" ADDED WILSON GRATUITUOUSLY : \" IF WARD'S STATEMENT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AS A FICTION PAPERBACK IN AMERICA, IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED OVERDRAWN AND BEYOND BELIEF . \"  WILSON SENT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WARDWIGG CONVERSATION TO MACMILLAN, WHO TURNED IT OVER TO THE \" APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES, \" WHO FOUND NOTHING DISTURBING IN IT . PRODDED FURTHER, MACMILLAN WROTE WILSON : \" THERE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING IN THE PAPERS YOU SENT WHICH REQUIRES ME TO TAKE ANY ACTION . / WHEN JOHN VASSALL, A HOMOSEXUAL ADMIRALTY CLERK, WAS CONVICTED LAST OCTOBER OF SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS, MACMILLAN SUMMARILY FIRED THE CLERK'S SUPERIOR, THOMAS GALBRAITH, WHO HAD WRITTEN THE CLERK SOME LETTERS STARTING \" MY DEAR VASSALL . \" GALBRAITH WAS LATER WHOLLY EXONERATED . THOUGH POSSIBLY NOT IN BRITAIN, WHERE TROPIC OF CANCER HAS BEEN A BESTSELLER FOR MONTHS AND THE UNEXPURGATED LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER HAS SOLD 3,500,000 PAPERBACK COPIES . EVEN AFTER WARD SENT WILSON, THE HOME SECRETARY AND THE ENTIRE BRITISH PRESS A LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PROFUMO HAD LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE DISCLOSURE \" DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE ANY IMPRESSION \" ON THE PRIME MINISTER . WHILE ORDERING THE LORD CHANCELLOR TO INVESTIGATE WARD'S CHARGES, MACMILLAN ASSURED WILSON HE WAS CONFIDENT NONETHELESS THAT THE SECURITY QUESTION HAD BEEN \" FULLY AND EFFICIENTLY WATCHED \" ALTHOUGH, AS WILSON ACCURATELY POINTED OUT, MI-5 MEN APPARENTLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTINE UNTIL THEY READ ABOUT HER IN THE PAPERS . AS THE DISMAL FACTS AND ALIBIS TUMBLED OUT IN THE COMMONS, THE ADULATION AND AFFECTION THE TORIES HAD ONCE BESTOWED ON \" MACWONDER \" TURNED ALMOST VISIBLY TO A KIND OF STUPEFIED PITY . AT THE END OF HIS DEFENSE, MACMILLAN PLEADED : \" I AM ENTITLED TO THE SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE AND OF THE COUNTRY . \" BUT FROM THE TORY BENCHES, AS HE SAT DOWN, CAME A SOUND THAT WAS MORE SIGH THAN CHEER . BY TWOS AND THREES, PERTURBED BACKBENCHERS WENT OUT TO ARGUE IN THE LOBBIES WHILE SEVERAL TORY SPEAKERS CAUSTICALLY CONDEMNED THE PRIME MINISTER . MACMILLAN ROSE AND WITH BOWED HEAD LEFT THE CHAMBER . WHO NEXT ? SOME ANGRY TORIES FELT THAT MACMILLAN SHOULD RESIGN AT ONCE, BUT AT A BACKBENCHERS' MEETING THE VIEW PREVAILED THAT, AS ONE CABINET MINISTER PUT IT, \" THE COUNTRY MUST NOT GET THE FEELING THAT HE IS BEING HOUNDED OUT BECAUSE OF CHRISTINE KEELER . OUR PARTY WOULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT . \" THE PRESENT CONSENSUS IS THAT MACMILLAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETIRE RATHER THAN TO RESIGN, SOME TIME THIS SUMMER OR FALL . IN PERSPECTIVE, HE MAY WELL REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTERS IN TORY HISTORY, BUT FEW CONSERVATIVES WANT HIM IN COMMAND OF THEIR NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN ; EVEN PREPROFUMO, THE PARTY HAD BEEN IN BAD TROUBLE OVER DEFENSE MUDDLES, BRITAIN'S FAILURE TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET, AND ABOVE ALL MACMILLAN'S STOP-AND-GO FISCAL POLICIES AND A SLUGGISH ECONOMY . ALTHOUGH MACMILLAN HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATED RIVALS BY GIVING THEM THANKLESS TASKS OR SACKING THEM, THE TORIES HAVE A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE SUCCESSORS . CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD (DAILY EXPRESS ODDS : 4-7) IS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING, WHO IS YOUTHFUL (46) AND READY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A PREDICTED ECONOMIC SPURT THIS SUMMER . HE IS ALSO HAPPILY MARRIED, A PARTICULARLY USEFUL QUALIFICATION RIGHT NOW . NEXT ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER \" RAB \" BUTLER (2-1), WHO HAS ALL THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE, BUT AT 60 MAY HAVE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG ; AND LORD HAILSHAM, BELLICOSE, BLIMPISH SCIENCE MINISTER, 55, WHOSE HOPES FADED RAPIDLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT ITS LORDS REFORM BILL, WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO SIT IN THE COMMONS, WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED THIS SUMMER . TED HEATH, 46, IS GENERALLY RULED OUT BECAUSE HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMON MARKET FAILURE, AND BESIDES, HE IS A BACHELOR . WHAT NEXT ? ANY ONE OF THESE TORIES COULD GIVE LABOR A GOOD FIGHT IN THE NEXT ELECTION, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE TO BE HELD TILL THE FALL OF 1964 . BUT LABORITES FEEL THEMSELVES CLOSER TO POWER THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY TIME IN THE LAST DOZEN YEARS . AT WEEK'S END HAROLD WILSON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK IN THE COMMONS, DEMANDING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PROFUMO CASE BY A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE WITH SWEEPOING POWERS . THE MORE LIMITED JUDICIAL INQUIRY PROPOSED BY MACMILLAN, CRIED WILSON, WAS MERELY \" A COVER-UP, \" BECAUSE, WITHOUT AUTHORITY TO COMPEL PROOF OF THE ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES, IT WOULD HAVE TO COLLECT EVIDENCE \" FROM SOME OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED LIARS IN THIS COUNTRY WERE THERE ANY MORE REVELATIONS TO COME WILSON WANTED TO KNOW . NOTHING HE KNEW OF RIGHT NOW, SAID MACMILLAN, BUT HE ADDED : \" I HAVE HEARD TERRIBLE THINGS SAID OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF ALL, CHRISTINE HERSELF, VOLUNTEERED : \" APART FROM THOSE I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IN MY STORY, I DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE NOT MET ANY MINISTERS . \" MACMILLAN RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE . \" THEY HAVE DEEPLY WOUNDED ME, \" HE TOLD A TORY RALLY, ADDING : \" IT WILL NOT BREAK MY SPIRIT . \" BUT THE HOUSE STILL REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF TORY REBEL NIGEL BIRCH, WHO DURING THE BIG DEBATE HAD QUOTED BROWNING'S THE LOST LEADER AT HAROLD MACMILLAN : LET HIM NEVER COME BACK TO US ! THERE WOULD BE DOUBT, HESITATION AND PAIN . FORCED PRAISE ON OUR PART THE GLIMMER OF TWILIGHT, NEVER GLAD CONFIDENT MORNING AGAIN !\n",

SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN STRASBOURG RINGINGLY CONDEMNED CHARLES DE GAULLE'S IMPERIOUS THUMBS DOWN ON BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET . AS A RESULT, DECLARED COMMON MARKET CHAIRMAN WALTER HALLSTEIN, THE SIX HAVE BEEN PLUNGED INTO THEIR \" FIRST REAL CRISIS A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE . \" IN EUROPEAN CAPITALS FROM BONN TO ROME, FRANCE'S COMMON MARKET PARTNERS SPOKE BRAVELY OF GANGING UP ON DE GAULLE, PERHAPS BY BLOCKING HIS PLANS FOR ASSOCIATING FRANCE'S FORMER AFRICAN COLONIES WITH EUROPE, OR EVEN BY BOYCOTTING FRENCH GOODS . EMPTY CHAIR ? BUT WHEN THE SPEECHES WERE OVER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARIANS SPEECHLESSLY REALIZED THAT THERE WAS ALMOST NO CONCRETE ACTION THAT THEY COULD TAKE AGAINST LE GRAND CHARLES . DE GAULLE SEEMED TO HOLD ALL THE TRUMPS . SOME MEMBERS OF THE OTHER COMMON MARKET FIVE HAD TALKED OF GIVING FRANCE THE \" EMPTY-CHAIR \" TREATMENT, CARRYING ON THEIR EFFORTS FOR EUROPEAN UNITY AND ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP WITHOUT THE FRENCH . YET WHAT PURPOSE WOULD IT SERVE TO EXCLUDE FRANCE FROM NATO COUNCILS ? NONE AT ALL . ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ALLIED FIGHTING STRENGTH ARE SUFFICIENTLY MEAGER IT IS TWO DIVISIONS BEHIND ITS COMMITMENTS IN GERMANY, IT WITHHOLDS ITS MEDITERRANEAN FLEET FROM NATO, KEEPS MOST OF ITS METROPOLITAN TERRITORY OUT OF THE AIR WARNING SYSTEM, AND EVEN PROHIBITS FOREIGN NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON FRENCH SOIL . STILL, SHEER GEOGRAPHY GIVES FRANCE A VETO ON NATO PLANNING . COULD FRANCE BE IGNORED IN THE TARIFF DISCUSSIONS OF THE 40-ODD MEMBERS OF GATT, OR IN OECD, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COORDINATING GROUP THAT GREW OUT OF THE MARSHALL PLAN ? HARDLY, SINCE THE ECONOMIES OF ALL WESTERN EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE INTERTWINED WITH FRANCE'S . THE URGENT FRENCH NEED TO EXPORT FOOD SURPLUSES, AND ITS BOOMING MARKET FOR OTHER NATIONS' INDUSTRIAL GOODS, ARE THE STICK AND THE CARROT THAT HAVE GIVEN THE COMMUNITY MUCH OF ITS MOMENTUM . EVEN BELGIUM'S PAUL-HENRI SPAAK, PERHAPS THE MOST IMPLACABLE FOE OF DE GAULLE'S PLANS FOR EUROPE, AGREED LAST WEEK THAT THERE WAS NO GENERAL SUPPORT FOR RETALIATORY MEASURES AGAINST FRANCE . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, WHO WAS IN TEARS AT BRUSSELS WHEN FRANCE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN, WENT HOME BREATHING DEFIANCE OF DE GAULLE AND THREATS TO TOPPLE KONRAD ADENAUER NOWHERE (SEE BELOW) . AND AFTER ALL THE ORATORY AT STRASBOURG, A \" SOLEMN PROTEST \" MOTION CONDEMNING DE GAULLE'S \" DOMINATION \" OF EUROPE WAS IGNOMINIOUSLY DEFEATED BY A TIE VOTE OF 38-38 HARDLY A RESOUNDING GESTURE OF DEFIANCE . PERSONALITY CHANGE . BY THEIR VERY LACK OF PASSION AT THE NEW REALITIES, EUROPEAN STATESMEN PROVED THAT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF LIFE IN DEEP-ROOTED NATIONALISM, WHETHER DE GAULLE'S OR ANYONE ELSE'S . THE COMMUNISTS HAD FOUND OUT THE SAME THING IN YUGOSLAVIA, POLAND, HUNGARY AND EAST GERMANY . THERE WERE DIFFERENCES : RUSSIA HAD TRIED TO IMPOSE A UNITY, AND WESTERN EUROPEANS HAD HOPED TO EVOLVE INTO A UNITY BY DEMOCRATIC MEANS AND FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT . WESTERN EUROPEANS STILL INSIST THAT THE IDEA OF EUROPE WILL CARRY THE DAY, BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF ONE ANOTHER'S DISPARATE TASTES, TALENTS AND DESTINIES . THE FRENCH, AWARE OF THE HOSTILITY OF ALLIES, WERE REASSURING EVERYBODY THAT THEY WERE NOT PROPOSING TO GO IT ALONE . FOREIGN MINISTER COUVE DE MURVILLE SAID : \" IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF FREEING THE EUROPEAN PERSONALITY BUT OF REMAINING INSIDE THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE . \" EVEN SO, EUROPE'S PERSONALITY HAD UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERGONE A CHANGE . SAID ONE MINISTER IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEK : \" FOR THE PRESENT, ONLY EXPECT THE THINGS TO BE DONE QUICKLY AROUND HERE THAT ARE PLAINLY GOOD FOR ALL THE SIX COUNTRIES .

EMOTIONALLY, A RETIRED GREEK GENERAL ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY READY TO SLASH HIS WRISTS TO GIVE BLOOD, IF DE GAULLE WERE SHOT . MORE PRUDENTLY, GREECE'S PREMIER CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS HAD HIS OWN BLOOD TYPED, IN CASE HE GOT IN THE WAY OF ANY SHOOTING . DRIFTING SMOKE . IN THE EVENT, THE PRECAUTIONS SEEMED EXCESSIVE . DE GAULLE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AT NOON IN HIS BLUE-ANDWHITE CARAVELLE JET AIRLINER, INSPECTED AN HONOR GUARD AS CANNON SMOKE FROM THE 21-GUN SALUTE DRIFTED INTO HIS FACE, THEN CLIMBED INTO A ROLLS-ROYCE CONVERTIBLE WITH GREECE'S TALL KING PAUL . AS THE MOTORCADE REACHED THE CITY LIMITS, DE GAULLE JUMPED TO HIS FEET, WAVED THEATRICALLY TO THE ATHENIANS GATHERED UNDER THE PEPPER TREES . AT HADRIAN'S ARCH, NEAR THE TEMPLE OF OLYMPIAN ZEUS, HE SAID WITH FEELING : \" NO FRENCHMAN, ESPECIALLY MYSELF, COULD FAIL TO BE MOVED BY THIS CITY, NOR FORGET WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED HERE FOR LIBERTY IN 3,000 YEARS . \" THEN HE PLUNGED NEARSIGHTEDLY INTO THE CURBSIDE CROWD TO SHAKE HANDS A PROCEDURE THAT GIVES HIS SECURITY GUARDS PERPETUAL JITTERS . BUT THE CHANCE OF A POTSHOT AT DE GAULLE WAS NOT THE ONLY WORRY OF GREEK LEADERS . THE GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO UNEASY THAT DE GAULLE MIGHT TRY TO EMBROIL GREECE IN HIS QUARREL WITH BRITAIN OVER THE COMMON MARKET, AND WITH THE U.S . OVER NATO DEFENSE . IT WAS FRANCE, NOT GREECE, WHICH HAD PUSHED THE TRIP . DE GAULLE HAD PICKED UP AN INVITATION MADE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE TO THEN PRESIDENT RENE COTY . PARIS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE FRENCH FLEET DROP ANCHOR IN THE PIRAEUS TO COINCIDE WITH DE GAULLE'S ARRIVAL, AND DISCREETLY BROACHED THE PLAN OF HAVING DE GAULLE ADDRESS THE GREEK PUBLIC, AS HE HAD DONE WITH SUCH SUCCESS DURING HIS GERMAN TOUR LAST YEAR . WHEN GREEK REACTION TO BOTH IDEAS WAS COOL, THEY WERE ABANDONED . THE HINGE . NEVERTHELESS, GREECE WAS IN A MOOD TO BE WOOED BY LE GRAND CHARLES . ATHENS OFFICIALS WERE SHOCKED LAST SUMMER, WHEN THE $20 MILLION ANNUAL U.S . DEFENSE AND ECONOMIC AID WAS ABRUPTLY CUT OFF ON THE THEORY THAT THE GREEK ECONOMY NO LONGER NEEDED IT . DE GAULLE IS SAID TO BE PREPARED TO CLIMAX HIS VISIT WITH AN OFFER OF A $10 MILLION DEVELOPMENT LOAN ; FRENCH INVESTMENTS IN GREECE ALREADY TOTAL $60X MILLION AND ARE SECOND ONLY TO U.S . INVESTMENT . AT A PALACE BANQUET, DE GAULLE MADE CLEAR IN A TOAST TO KING PAUL THAT HE HOPES TO EXTEND FRANCE'S INFLUENCE FROM THE \" NORTHERN SEAS, \" WHICH HE CALLED ONE OF FRANCE'S BOUNDARIES, TO THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN, WHERE, HE POINTED OUT, GREECE IS THE \" HINGE BETWEEN THE LATIN AND SLAVIC WORLDS, AS WELL AS BETWEEN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST . \" THESE WORDS, AND DE GAULLE'S WOOING MANNER, SET DIPLOMATS EVERYWHERE TO A FRESH STUDY OF HIS UPCOMING AMBITIOUS TRAVEL PLANS : IN OCTOBER, CHARLES DE GAULLE, 72, IS SCHEDULED TO VISIT IRAN AND HE IS CONSIDERING LATER TRIPS TO JAPAN, SOUTH AMERICA, NORTH AFRICA, AND THE NEWLY INDEPENDENT NATIONS OF BLACK AFRICA . \" TODAY, FRANCE, \" MURMURED ONE DAZZLED OBSERVER . \" TOMORROW THE WORLD . /\n",

THE INFECTIOUS PRESIDENTIAL FEVER HAS SPREAD TO ALL PARTIES . ON THE NON-GAULLIST SIDE, POSSIBLE CANDIDATES RANGE FROM ANTOINE PINAY (AT 71, HE MAY BE TOO OLD) TO THE LAST PREMIER OF THE FOURTH REPUBLIC, PIERRE PFLIMLIN, TO THE GLIB RADICAL SPOKESMAN, MAURICE FAURE . THE SOCIALISTS HAVE CONTENDERS IN VETERAN GUY MOLLET AND THE SHREWD, AFFABLE MAYOR OF MARSEILLE, GASTON DEFFERRE .

RECENTLY ELECTED AS A DEPUTY FROM REUNION ISLAND, DEBRE CANNILY REFUSED THE CONFINING JOB OF FACTION LEADER OF THE GAULLISTS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS MR . FIXIT FOR PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . UNDER THE SPUR OF DEBRE'S COMPETITION, POMPIDOU IS NOW FUNCTIONING MORE LIKE A POLITICIAN AND LESS LIKE A BANKER TURNED STATESMAN .

INTO THIS LIST OF HOPEFULS, THE INTELLECTUAL, LEFT-WING L'EXPRESS LAST WEEK INTRODUCED A WEIRDLY DIFFERENT SUGGESTION . IT CLAIMED THAT DE GAULLE'S OWN CHOICE AS HIS SUCCESSOR IS NONE OTHER THAN HENRI D'ORLEANS, 54, COMTE DE PARIS, DESCENDANT OF KING HENRI IV, AND PRETENDER TO THE THRONE OF FRANCE .

BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD HOME AND FRANCE'S FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHO HAVE BEEN SNUBBING ONE ANOTHER EVER SINCE BRITAIN WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMON MARKET LAST JANUARY, ALSO EXCHANGED CIVILITIES .

SKEPTICS NOTED THAT FRANCE'S GOVERNMENT SEEMED MORE INCLINED TO TALK COOPERATION THAN TO PRACTICE IT . AFTER INDICATING THAT THEY MIGHT HONOR A 15-MONTH-OLD AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT U.S.-CONTROLLED WARHEADS FOR ITS GERMAN-BASED F-100 FIGHTERBOMBERS, THE FRENCH BRUSQUELY DENIED THAT THEY HAD ANY PRESENT PLANS \" CONCERNING THE USE OF THESE PLANES WITHIN NATO . \" NOTHING DAUNTED, U.S . OFFICIALS IN PARIS LEAKED WISHFUL REPORTS THAT FRANCE'S NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE IS BADLY BEHIND SCHEDULE AND BESET WITH EVERMOUNTING TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS . DE GAULLE, IT WAS HINTED, WAS ABOUT READY TO RETURN TO THE NATO FOLD . NOT SO, RETORTED A HIGH-RANKING FRENCH OFFICIAL . FRANCE, HE INSISTED, WILL HAVE ITS FIRST 50 MIRAGE IV A-BOMBERS IN SERVICE BY DECEMBER 1965, ON SCHEDULE ; EXPECTS TO HAVE ITS OWN H-BOMB \" WELL BEFORE \" 1970 ; AND IS ACTUALLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE WITH ITS MISSILE-LAUNCHING SUBMARINE, NOW DUE IN 1968 . THUS DE GAULLE HAD NO REASON TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS DECLARED AIM OF NUCLEAR INDEPENDENCE . AS THE GAULLIST PARIS-PRESSE POINTED OUT, \" IT IS HIS PARTNERS WHO HAVE GREATLY CHANGED THEIR TONE \" SINCE THE GENERAL REJECTED THE U.S . OFFER OF NATO-COMMITTED POLARIS MISSILES LAST JANUARY . THE U.S . WAS STILL PUSHING ITS LONG-TERM PLAN FOR A SURFACE POLARIS FLEET MANNED BY MIXED CREWS . HOWEVER, BRITAIN HAS LITTLE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA, WHILE WEST GERMANY AND ITALY, WHICH WERE BOTH ENTHUSIASTIC AT FIRST, HAVE NOW INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER SINK THEIR MONEY IN MULTIMANNED POLARIS SUBMARINES . WHAT THE U.S . DID WIN LAST WEEK WAS SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT FROM ITS ALLIES EXCLUDING FRANCE ON THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF A MORE LIMITED SCHEME, THE INTER-ALLIED, NATOCONTROLLED STRIKE FORCE THAT WASHINGTON HOPES TO CREATE IN THE NEAR FUTURE . JUST A GIMMICK ? AFTER A NATO SESSION IN PARIS AND CONFERENCES IN LONDON ATTENDED BY RUSK, DEFENSE SECRETARY MCNAMARA AND OTHER TOP POLICYMAKERS, THE U.S . ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD PRESENT NEXT MONTH'S NATO MEETING IN OTTAWA WITH DETAILED PLANS FOR A NUCLEAR COMMAND AND PLANNING STRUCTURE TO INTEGRATE THE NEW INTER-ALLIED FORCE . IT WOULD INCLUDE BRITAIN'S V-BOMBERS AND, IN 1968, ITS POLARIS FLEET, AS WELL AS THREE POLARIS SUBMARINES THAT THE U.S . HAS COMMITTED TO NATO, AND OTHER ALLIED AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES . SOME ALLIED PLANNERS DISMISSED THE U.S . PROPOSALS AS MERE \" GIMMICKRY . \" BUT AFTER ALL IT WAS WESTERN EUROPE THAT HAD BEEN CLAMORING FOR A GREATER ROLE IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS POLICY .

BLOSSOMING FORTH IN EVER MORE DAZZLING PHOTOGRAPHS SHE BECAME BRITAIN'S FASTEST-RISING FALLEN WOMAN . SHE WAS BESIEGED BY FILM AND NIGHTCLUB OFFERS AND INCORPORATED HERSELF AS CHRISTINE KEELER, LTD . SHE EVEN LANDED, UNCAPTIONED, ON THE COVER OF THE AUSTERE ECONOMIST . AS FOR HER MENTOR, OSTEOPATH STEPHEN WARD, HE WAS IN JAIL, BOUND FOR TRIAL ON CHARGES OF LIVING ON PROSTITUTES' EARNINGS . THE EVIDENCE, IT WAS WIDELY SUSPECTED, WOULD PROVE DAMAGING TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE . ALTHOUGH THE LABOR PARTY CONCENTRATED ON THE SECURITY QUESTION, IN PUBLIC DEBATE THE PROFUMO CASE INEVITABLY TURNED INTO A MORAL ISSUE . SIGNIFICANTLY, THE UNPARDONABLE CRIME OF EX-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR JOHN PROFUMO WAS NOT THAT HE WAS INDISCREET AND A POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK, BUT THAT HE LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN INITIALLY DENYING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRISTINE . MOREOVER, HE LIED STUPIDLY, SINCE HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIS DIGNITY AND HIS SEAT AS AN M.P . BY ADMITTING HIS MISSTEP .

HE HAD GOOD REASON FOR CONFIDENCE : THE DAILY MAIL'S NATIONAL OPINION POLL GAVE LABOR ITS BIGGEST LEAD EVER : 69.2 PER CENT TO 19.8 PER CENT OVER THE TORIES . ON HIS RETURN FROM A GOLFING VACATION, MACMILLAN'S FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMMAND A UNITED CABINET . CALLING HIS MINISTERS INTO EMERGENCY SESSION, HE ASKED EACH MAN TO OUTLINE PRIVATELY HIS OWN VIEW OF THE SITUATION . WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE 21 TOP TORIES EXPRESSED DEEP DISMAY AT THE PUBLIC'S LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT . MACMILLAN WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO ALMOST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT POSSIBILITIES . HAD HE KNOWN ABOUT PROFUMO'S DOINGS, AND IN THAT CASE HAD HE NOT CONNIVED TO SOME EXTENT IN HIS FALSE DENIALS ? OR, DESPITE THE WAR MINISTER'S LONG REPUTATION AS A WOMANIZER, HAD MACMILLAN REALLY NOT KNOWN ANYTHING ? IN THAT CASE, HAD HE NOT BEEN NAIVE AND NEGLIGENT WHEN HE ACCEPTED PROFUMO'S DEFENSE ? BED & BAWD . IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, MACMILLAN MAINTAINS THAT HE WAS FIRST INFORMED OF PROFUMO'S LIAISON LAST FEBRUARY . HE DENIES REPORTS THAT MI-5 BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD WARNED THE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME THAT ITS WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED BED AND BAWD WITH SOVIET ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV . MACMILLAN INSISTED THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT A MAN OF PROFUMO'S BACKGROUND (HARROW, OXFORD, INFANTRY) . MOREOVER, FIVE OF HIS MINISTERS WHO \" SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT \" OF MARCH 21 INTERROGATING PROFUMO WERE ALSO PERSUADED THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ; THE CLINCHER WAS THE WAR MINISTER'S READINESS TO DENY MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE KEELER IN A SACROSANCT \" PERSONAL STATEMENT \" ON THE HOUSE FLOOR NEXT DAY . MACMILLAN'S STRONGEST ARGUMENT WAS THAT A SECURITY CHECK, WHICH HE ORDERED A WEEK BEFORE HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE'S CONFESSION, HAD TURNED UP NO EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN USING THE PROFUMO-KEELER-IVANOV TRIANGLE TO PRY OUT SECRET INFORMATION . SOMETHING OF A CABINET MUTINY SEEMED TO BE LED BY HEALTH MINISTER ENOCH POWELL, 51, WHOSE DISTASTE FOR POLITICAL COMPROMISE LED HIM TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958 IN PROTEST AGAINST AN INFLATIONARY, VOTE-CATCHING BUDGET . POWELL'S FEELING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ONCE MORE SHOWN ITSELF UNBELIEVABLY LAX WAS SHARED TO A LESSER DEGREE BY TWO MORE OF MACMILLAN'S ABLEST APPOINTEES, EDUCATION MINISTER SIR EDWARD BOYLE (WHO QUIT THE GOVERNMENT OVER SUEZ) AND HOUSING MINISTER SIR KEITH JOSEPH, AS WELL AS A DISGRUNTLED MINORITY OF TORY BACKBENCHERS, WHO COULD THEMSELVES OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT IF 20 OR 30 CHOSE TO ABSTAIN THIS WEEK . BUT MACMILLAN'S ASSURANCES QUELLED THE MUTINY, AND THE TORIES MARCHED INTO COMMONS OUTWARDLY UNITED TO FACE THEIR GREATEST POLITICAL THREAT SINCE SUEZ . AN ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT THE DATE ON WHICH THE U.S . WAS SUPPOSED TO \" GIVE THE H-BOMB TO WEST GERMANY, \" SOUNDED MORE LIKE A PROPAGANDA PLOY THAN SERIOUS ESPIONAGE . FLASH OF INDIGNATION . THE OPPOSITION MAY YET SUCCEED IN SHOWING THAT BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM WAS IN FACT BREACHED, OR THAT WARNINGS FROM INTELLIGENCE FELL ON DEAF EARS . WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THIS WEEK'S COMMONS DEBATE, THERE IS A GROWING BELIEF THAT MACMILLAN WILL HAVE TO STEP DOWN EVENTUALLY AND MAY IN FACT HAVE PROMISED HIS OWN DISSIDENT MINISTERS TO DO SO ONCE THE HEAT IS OFF . LOOSE FACTIONS WERE ALREADY FORMING AROUND SUCH POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TO MACMILLAN AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R . A .

NO MATTER HOW ELOQUENTLY MACMILLAN MAY WEATHER THE PARLIAMENTARY CRISIS, THE TORIES SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE TARRED BY CHRISTINE . WHAT THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY OFFERED THE NATION IS MEN BORN AND RAISED IN THE EXACTING DISCIPLINES OF LEADERSHIP . IF NOW, IN ADDITION TO ALL THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REVERSES THEY HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST YEAR, BRITONS SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT ETONIAN AND HARROVIAN LEADERS ARE PERSONALLY NO WISER OR MORE UPRIGHT AND IN MANY CASES THEY HAVE PROVED FLAGRANTLY LESS SO THAN THOSE WHOM THEY GOVERN, TWELVE YEARS OF TORY GOVERNMENT MAY END IN A MIGHTY FLASH OF MORAL INDIGNATION MIXED WITH RIDICULE .\n",

BOTH FRENCH AND GERMANS LEGITIMATELY EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO-DAY TRIP WAS ONLY A \" WORKING VISIT \" AS STIPULATED BY THE BRAND-NEW FRANCO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATY . AS FAR AS PROTOCOL AND THE PUBLIC WERE CONCERNED, IT WAS EVEN A KIND OF UNVISIT NO PARADES, NO CROWDS . THE BONN PRESS PREDICTED THAT DE GAULLE WOULD TRY TO WHIP THE GERMANS INTO LINE IN CASE THEY HAD GOT TOO FRIENDLY TOWARD THE U.S . HE WAS NOT AS CRUDE AS THAT . BUT HE HAD BEEN STUNG BY KENNEDY'S FRANKFURT SPEECH ABOUT ATLANTIC UNITY (ALTHOUGH DISMISSING IT AS \" SALADE, SALADE, SALADE \" ), AND DE GAULLE OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO FIND OUT IN BONN IF THE GERMANS HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED BY IT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE FRANCO-GERMAN ALLIANCE . ANSWER : THE GERMANS WERE JUST ABOUT STANDING STILL . THEY CHIDED DE GAULLE AND HIS TOP MINISTERS FOR THE ANNOUNCED WITHDRAWAL OF FRENCH NAVAL UNITS FROM THE NATO FLEET BUT DID NOT PRESS HIM ON THE QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S EVENTUAL ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . THERE WAS SOME HAGGLING ON AGRICULTURE ; BECAUSE OF A PRICE-DEPRESSING AGRICULTURAL SURPLUS, WHICH CAUSED FARM RIOTS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE LAST WEEK, THE FRENCH HAD JUST CLOSED THEIR BORDERS TO IMPORTS OF TOMATOES AND APRICOTS, WITHOUT NOTIFYING THE COMMON MARKET .

THE SITUATION IS VERY GRAVE . \" ABSOLUTE SECRECY . ALL WEEK THERE HAD BEEN A STRANGE SENSATION IN MOSCOW THAT MAYBE THERE WAS NO SINO-SOVIET MEETING AT ALL . THE KREMLIN ACTED AS THOUGH THE SHOWDOWN NEVER TOOK PLACE . DOM PRIEMOV, THE RECEPTION HOUSE WHERE THE SESSIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HELD, WAS CAREFULLY AVOIDED BY SOVIET REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS . ASKED WHY, A MOSCOW NEWS EXECUTIVE SAID SARCASTICALLY : \" IT'S PAYDAY . THEY'VE ALL GONE FOR THEIR MONEY . \" AFTER MEETING TWICE TO DISCUSS FORMALITIES, THE RUSSIANS AND RED CHINESE MET ONLY THREE TIMES DURING THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS . JUST BEFORE ONE SESSION BEGAN, A WESTERN REPORTER ASKED A SOVIET PLAINCLOTHESMAN WHAT TIME THE PEKING DELEGATION WAS EXPECTED . THE COP SHRUGGED AND SAID : \" YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THEM . THEY ARE A VERY DISORGANIZED PEOPLE . WE WAITED FOR THEM YESTERDAY, AND THEY NEVER DID SHOW UP . \" THE RED CHINESE DELEGATION APPARENTLY SPENT MOST OF ITS TIME DRIVING THROUGH THE LENIN HILLS SECTION OF THE CITY IN BLACK LIMOUSINES, SHUTTLING MYSTERIOUSLY FROM PEKING'S EMBASSY TO DOM PRIEMOV TO THE VILLA WHERE THEY LIVED . WESTERN NEWSMEN ONCE GLIMPSED TENG HSIAO-PING, THE LEADER OF PEKING'S GROUP, SERENELY STROLLING THROUGH THE VILLA'S GARDENS . THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE BEHIND THE MASSIVE, CREAM-COLORED WALLS OF DOM PRIEMOV WERE THE BOOTS OF A SOVIET SOLDIER, WHICH PROTRUDED BENEATH THE SPIKED IRON GATES WHEN HE OPENED A PEEPHOLE TO SCRUTINIZE AN ARRIVING AUTOMOBILE . FOR THE FIRST TIME, RUSSIANS WERE WILLING TO TALK AND EVEN TO JOKE ABOUT THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT . ONE CRACK MAKING THE ROUNDS IN MOSCOW SUGGESTED THAT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE WHOLE THING WAS FOR MAO TSE-TUNG AND CHARLES DE GAULLE TO CONCLUDE AN ALLIANCE, THUS LETTING THE TWO TROUBLEMAKERS TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER . ABSOLUTE EQUALITY . TRHOUGHOUT THE ON-AND-OFF MEETINGS, THE IDEOLOGICAL FIRE CONTINUED ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE DELEGATES . THE OMINOUSLY WARNED PEKING OF THE \" DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES \" OF ITS POLICY . AS FOR NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, HE CALLED OUT THE BRASS BANDS, HONOR GUARD AND TELEVISION CAMERAS TO WELCOME HUNGARY'S JANOS KADAR, WHO REPAID THE FLATTERY BY ONCE AGAIN BACKING MOSCOW'S LINE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE . RED CHINA, WHOSE DELEGATION'S ARRIVAL IN MOSCOW WAS DOWNPLAYED BY THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT AND DELIBERATELY IGNORED BY THE SOVIET PRESS, FIRED ITS OWN VOLLEY OF INSULTS . FOR THE FIRST TIME, PEKING CLAIMED ABSOLUTE EQUALITY WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION AND WARNED THE KREMLIN IN AN ELABORATE SIMILE : \" NO GENUINE UNITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY AN ATTITUDE THAT ALLOWS THE MAGISTRATE TO BURN DOWN HOUSES, WHILE FORBIDDING THE COMMON PEOPLE EVEN TO LIGHT THEIR LAMPS . \" ALL THESE SINO-SOVIET EXCHANGES WERE CAREFULLY FRAMED TO PUT THE BLAME FOR THE SPLIT ON THE OTHER FELLOW . OBVIOUSLY THE CHINESE NEVER EXPECTED THE MOSCOW MEETING TO SUCCEED, INSISTED ON IT MERELY TO EMBARRASS THE SOVIETS . THE KREMLIN, IN TURN, COULD NOT AFFORD TO APPEAR INTRACTABLE . AT WEEK'S END THE PEKING PRESS SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS A FEW OF THE SINO-SOVIET DIFFERENCES COULD BE SETTLED SOON, WHILE OTHERS COULD BE DEFERRED TILL LATER . THIS SIMPLY MEANT THAT THE CHINESE WERE READY TO PROLONG THE QUARREL INDEFINITELY . \" IF THE DIFFERENCES CANNOT BE RESOLVED THIS YEAR, \" SAID PEKING BLANDLY, \" THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR . \" THE RUSSIANS ARE LESS PATIENT . THEY SHOT BACK AN ANSWERING COMMUNIQUE WARNING PEKING THAT \" THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE \" WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE SPLIT WILL WIDEN . THEN MOSCOW GAVE THE RED CHINESE AND THE WEST A POINTED REMINDER .

      "     Preview: PEKING ANTICIPATING PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TUMULTUOUS WEST BERLIN RECEPTION, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HASTILY ARRANGED A TRIP OF HIS OWN . HE DECIDED TO GO TO EAST BERLIN, OSTENSIBLY TO CELEBRATE THE 70TH BIRTHDAY OF EAST GERMANY'S SPADEBEARDED COMMUNIST BOSS WALTER ULBRICHT . JUST 48 HOURS AFTER KENNEDY, ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE WALL, HAD CRIED, \" I AM A BERLINER, \" KHRUSHCHEV ARRIVED ON THE EAST SIDE, BENT ON SHOWING THAT HE WAS A BERLINER TOO . BUT THE THIN WELCOMING CROWD WAS NOT EXACTLY EAGER TO MAKE HIM AN HONORARY CITIZEN . MINUTES BEFORE KHRUSHCHEV'S TURBOPROP LANDED AT SCHONEFELD AIRPORT, AN ANNOUNCER DRILLED THE SPECTATORS IN A PROPER GREETING : \" NOW, WHEN OUR FRIEND STEPS OUT OF HIS PLANE, WE WILL ALL CHEER IN UNISON, HIP, HIP, HURRAH . \" WHEN NIKITA STEPPED OUT OF HIS PLANE, ALL SMILES, THE CROWD WAS SILENT AND ONLY THE HONOR GUARD OF SOLDIERS SHOUTED, OFFICIALLY . IN CONTRAST TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S WELCOME BY MORE THAN A MILLION WEST BERLINERS, A SCANT 250,000 EAST BERLIN FACTORY WORKERS, SECRETARIES AND SCHOOLCHILDREN, MARCHING IN CLOSED FORMATIONS, TURNED OUT FOR KHRUSHCHEV . ALONG PARTS OF THE 16-MILE ROUTE TO THE RED CITY HALL, THE ONLY SPECTATORS WERE THE VOLKSPOLIZEI . THE REAL REASON FOR KHRUSHCHEV'S PRESENCE IN EAST BERLIN, OF COURSE, WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED TO HELP ULBRICHT BLOW OUT THE CANDLES, NOR WAS IT ENTIRELY A MATTER OF TRYING TO COUNTERACT THE EMOTIONS STIRRED UP BY THE KENNEDY VISIT . MOST OF ALL, KHRUSHCHEV WANTED TO MEET WITH HIS EAST EUROPEAN SATELLITE CHIEFS TO CLOSE RANKS BEFORE THE CHINESE ARRIVE IN MOSCOW THIS WEEK TO CONFER ON THE WORSENING SINO-SOVIET IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT . DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM . THEIR DISPUTE GREW SO ANGRY LAST WEEK THAT MOSCOW RESORTED TO EXPELLING CHINESE DIPLOMATS, A TREATMENT HITHERTO RESERVED FOR WESTERN REPRESENTATIVES . BEHIND THIS LATEST EXPLOSION WAS A 24,000-WORD PEKING BLAST AT KHRUSHCHEV'S POLICIES, DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT HIS PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE LINE IS A COWARDLY BETRAYAL OF TRUE RED REVOLUTIONARIES, THAT HE IS SHILLY-SHALLYING WITH THE \" PAPER TIGERS \" OF IMPERIALISM, AND THAT HE IS \" SUBVERTING \" OTHER COMMUNIST PARTIES . WHEN THE RUSSIANS REFUSED TO PUBLISH THE PEKING LETTER, ISSUED TWO WEEKS AGO, THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN MOSCOW STARTED CIRCULATING COPIES, THEREBY PROVOKING THE KREMLIN TO THROW OUT THREE EMBASSY ATTACHES AND TWO OTHER CHINESE . PEKING CALLED THE ACTION \" UNREASONABLE AND UNTENABLE, \" NOTED THAT IT WAS \" UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, \" AND ACCUSED MOSCOW OF DELIBERATELY TRYING TO CREATE OBSTACLES TO THE SCHEDULED TALKS . EVEN AS KHRUSHCHEV ARRIVED IN EAST BERLIN, THE CHINESE EMBASSY THERE WENT RIGHT AHEAD DISTRIBUTING COPIES OF THE PEKING MANIFESTO TO INTERESTED BYSTANDERS . STALIN'S GHOST . ON HAND FOR TALKS WITH KHRUSHCHEV IN EAST BERLIN WERE THE SATELLITE CHIEFS OF POLAND, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, HUNGARY AND BULGARIA . ABSENT, AT LEAST FROM AMONG EARLY ARRIVALS : RUMANIAN RED BOSS GHEORGHE GHEORGHIUDEJ, WHO IS NOT ONLY FEUDING WITH MOSCOW OVER ECONOMIC PLANNING BUT IS WARM TOWARD PEKING, ALLOWED ITS MANIFESTO TO APPEAR IN THE RUMANIAN PRESS . WHAT CONFRONTED THE SMALL-SCALE RED SUMMIT MEETING WAS THE PICTURE OF THE SINO-SOVIET RIFT TEARING INTO THE COMMUNIST FABRIC ALL OVER THE WORLD . IN MOSCOW, A MASSIVE INTERNATIONAL CONVOCATION OF FEMALE COMRADES FOUND THE RUSSIA-CHINA ISSUE A CAUSE FOR NEARHYSTERIA (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) . SUCH RED FRONT ORGANIZATIONS AS THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS AND THE WORLD PEACE COUNCIL HAVE ALSO STARTED SQUABBLING OVER THE ISSUE . IN ASIA, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA, MANY COMMUNIST PARTIES ARE FEELING THE SPLIT ; WHERE COMMUNISM HAS PROSPERED BY APPEARING \" MODERATE, \" PARTY LEADERS BLUNTLY DENOUNCE RED CHINA AND ARE BEGINNING TO PURGE PEKING PARTISANS . EVEN IN WESTERN EUROPE'S OVERWHELMINGLY PRO-MOSCOW PARTIES, SOME YOUNG REDS HAVE RESPONDED TO PEKING'S REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL, HAVE JOINED RED CHINESE \" FRIENDSHIP SOCIETIES . \" KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF BUSILY COUNTERATTACKED AGAINST THE CHINESE . BEFORE HIS BERLIN TRIP, AT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING IN MOSCOW WHOSE CHIEF TASK WAS TO COPE WITH THE RESTLESSNESS OF RUSSIA'S OWN INTELLECTUALS, KHRUSHCHEV DEALT WITH THE MORE URGENT PEKING PROBLEM . TYPICALLY, HE INTERPRETED PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S \" STRATEGY OF PEACE \" SPEECH AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LAST MONTH AS A SIGN OF WESTERN WEAKNESS, USED IT AS EVIDENCE THAT HIS POLICY OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE IS PAYING OFF . THE RED CHINESE, SAID KHRUSHCHEV, ARE REALLY PESSIMISTS IN PURSUING A NOW-OR-NEVER REVOLUTIONARY DOGMA, BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A DESPERATE HURRY TO START WARS AND REVOLUTIONS IF THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN THE LONG-RANGE, INEVITABLE VICTORY OF COMMUNISM . MOREOVER, THEY USE \" THE NATIONAL, RACIAL APPROACH \" IN WIDENING THE SCHISM BETWEEN COMMUNISTS . KHRUSHCHEV ALSO HEATEDLY DEFENDED HIS DESTALINIZATION DRIVE, ATTACKED MAO TSE-TUNG (WITHOUT NAMING HIM) FOR BUILDING HIS OWN CULT OF PERSONALITY . SAID KHRUSHCHEV, RAISING HIS FAVORITE GHOST : \" WE ARE AGAINST LEADERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD, AND THAT THE PEOPLE ARE A MASS THAT MUST LISTEN ONLY TO THEM AND APPLAUD . THAT WAS TYPICAL OF STALIN . \" AMID THESE EXCHANGES, THE ATMOSPHERE COULD SCARCELY BE MORE UNPLEASANT FOR THE SCHEDULED SINO-SOVIET ENCOUNTER THIS WEEK IF INDEED BOTH PARTIES ARE NOT TOO ANGRY TO GO THROUGH WITH IT . THE SPLIT, WESTERN OBSERVERS WERE CAREFUL TO POINT OUT, WAS STILL NOT \" FINAL AND FORMAL . \" BUT AS AN INFORMAL QUARREL, IT SEEMED TO BE AT LEAST IN THE QUARTER-FINALS .\n",

EVENTUALLY, BY STATE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE, THERE WILL BE MORE THAN 100 SIGNATORIES .

IN A BITTER RADIO ATTACK, THE CHINESE SAID THAT THE \" REAL AIM OF THE SOVIET LEADERS \" IN NEGOTIATING THE TEST BAN \" IS TO COMPROMISE WITH THE U.S .

SO FAR, THESE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL NOT SIGN .

DESPITE THE $1,000,000 A DAY THAT RUSSIA IS POURING INTO HIS ISLAND COMMUNE, FIDEL CASTRO IS STILL ANGRY OVER KHRUSHCHEV'S WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET ROCKETS LAST FALL . TRYING TO MAKE THE SOVIET LEADER SWEAT, CASTRO IS OBVIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO BOOST HIS PRICE FOR SUPPORTING RUSSIA IN ITS STRUGGLE WITH THE CHINESE . BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT CUBA WILL ULTIMATELY SIGN THE TREATY, FOR CASTRO NEEDS RUSSIA TO BUY HIS 3,800,000-TON SUGAR CROP AND TO CONTINUE STEADY TRANSFUSION OF ECONOMIC AID . THE LONELY ONES . THE SOLE NONSIGNER IN THE WESTERN CAMP IS FRANCE . EVEN FRANCO SPAIN, THE ONLY WESTERN COUNTRY WHICH DOES NOT HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW, HAS SIGNED THE TREATY, LEAVING FRANCE ISOLATED FROM ALL ITS CONTINENTAL NEIGHBORS . MOST GALLING TO CHARLES DE GAULLE WAS WEST GERMANY'S DECISION TO SIGN THE PACT AFTER A REASSURING PITCH IN BONN BY U.S . SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK . BONN'S ACTION WAS DOUBLY UPSETTING TO FRANCE, FOR IT FOLLOWED AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT GERMANY AND THE U.S . WILL COOPERATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW BATTLE TANK (TIME, AUG . 16) ; JUST THREE MONTHS AGO, PARIS WAS UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GERMANS ON A SIMILAR PROJECT . BOTH BONN DECISIONS RAISED THE QUESTION OF JUST HOW MUCH THE FRANCO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATY IS WORTH, AND BROUGHT INTO THE OPEN THE FACT THAT WEST GERMANY STILL LOOKS TO THE U.S . AND NOT TO FRANCE FOR LEADERSHIP . STUBBORNLY FRANCE PREPARED FOR ANOTHER ATOMIC TEST IN THE SAHARA, BUT DE GAULLE'S ASPIRATIONS TO FRENCH LEADERSHIP OF EUROPE WERE ACIDLY DEMOLISHED BY PARIS' LE FIGARO . \" IF KHRUSHCHEV REALLY BECOMES DISTURBED BY THE CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED AGAINST HIM BY CHINA, \" SAID THE PAPER, \" AND IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A CERTAINTY OF PEACE ON HIS WESTERN FRONT, THEN HE WILL NOT COME TO SEEK AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE, WHICH IS NEGLIGIBLE IN HIS EYES, EVEN WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS, BUT WITH THE U.S., WHOSE INFLUENCE AND POWER ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES SUPERIOR .

THEIR TROUBLED MOOD IS INDEFINABLE BUT INESCAPABLE . IT IS A SENSE OF UNEASE IN WHICH IS BLENDED THE AWARENESS OF NATIONAL DECLINE, THE CONSCIOUS SENSE OF FAILURE TO FIND NEW OUTLETS FOR THEIR ENERGIES, A FEELING THAT MANY OF THEIR HALLOWED INSTITUTIONS AND TRADITIONS ARE INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT TO A FORMIDABLY CHANGED WORLD .

GAP NONETHELESS, BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY IS POISED ON A KNIFE EDGE . IN THE PAST DECADE, ITS ECONOMY HAS GROWN ONLY 2FY PER YEAR ON AVERAGE ; IN 1962 IT ROSE ONLY 1 PER CENT , WHEREAS IN THE COMMON MARKET EVEN A 4 PER CENT GROWTH RATE IS CONSIDERED DISAPPOINTING . SINCE 1950, BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS CRISES HAVE BROUGHT BRITAIN TO THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY SIX TIMES . BY DRACONIAN MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT SUCCEEDED LAST YEAR IN BOOSTING EXPORTS 3 PER CENT FOR A NEW $11 BILLION POSTWAR RECORD, HELPING TO MAINTAIN GOLD AND HARD-CURRENCY RESERVES . HOWEVER, IT WAS ONLY ABLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY BY CUTTING BACK CREDIT AND CURBING INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION . \" OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HAD THEIR ECONOMIC MIRACLES, \" SIGHS A MANCHESTER JOURNALIST . \" BRITAIN HAS HAD ITS CRISES . \" BRITAIN NEEDED URGENTLY TO EXPAND ITS MARKETS AND BROADEN ITS SHAKY FINANCIAL BASE . ONCE INSIDE EUROPE, BRITISH INDUSTRY WAS CONFIDENT THAT IT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST EXPORTS TO THE SIX . IT ALSO ANTICIPATED A HEAVY INFLUX OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL FROM U.S . AND OTHER FOREIGN COMPANIES EAGER TO HAVE A BRITISH TOEHOLD IN THE COMMON MARKET . IF BRITAIN WERE FINALLY EXCLUDED FROM EUROPE, INVESTMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO DWINDLE AND BRITAIN MIGHT BE FORCED AS A RESULT TO MAKE DRASTIC CUTS IN ITS LIVING STANDARDS . MEANWHILE, IT MAY EITHER RETREAT BEHIND HIGH TARIFF WALLS OR ELSE RETURN TO ITS CLASSIC IDEAL OF FREE TRADE, POSSIBLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE U.S . AND EUROPEAN NATIONS OUTSIDE THE MARKET . THIS WEEK, AS M.P.S FLOCKED BACK TO WESTMINSTER FROM THE CHRISTMAS RECESS, UNEMPLOYMENT THREATENED TO BE AN EVEN MORE EXPLOSIVE ISSUE THAN THE COLLAPSE OF THE COMMON MARKET NEGOTIATIONS . THE GOVERNMENT'S BEST ASSET IN TIME OF CRISIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRIME MINISTER, A POLITICAL MACHOUDINI WHO CAN SLITHER OUT OF ALMOST ANY TRAP BY SHEER SLEIGHT-OF-HAND . UNDISTURBED BY THE COUNTRY'S MOUNTING FRUSTRATION OVER UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING, MACMILLAN DID NOT SWING INTO ACTION UNTIL LAST SUMMER, AFTER THE TORIES HAD SUFFERED THE WORST SERIES OF BY-ELECTION REVERSES INFLICTED ON A BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN 40 YEARS . IN HIS THIRD AND MOST DRASTIC CABINET RESHUFFLE SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE, MACMILLAN PURGED HALF HIS MINISTERS, HANDED KEY POSTS TO SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG POLITICIANS EAST OF THE NEW FRONTIER . TO GINGER UP THE FALTERING ECONOMY, NEW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING CUT INTEREST RATES, GAVE GENEROUS NEW TAX CONCESSIONS TO INDUSTRY, SLASHED PURCHASE TAXES ON AUTOS AND A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER GOODS . TO SPEED HOMEBUILDING AND SLUM CLEARANCE A TASK THAT MACMILLAN HIMSELF DISCHARGED WITH DISTINCTION IN HIS FIRST CABINET POST IN 1951 THE PRIME MINISTER BROUGHT IN SIR KEITH JOSEPH, 45, AN ASTUTE POLITICIAN AND ONETIME CONSTRUCTION COMPANY EXECUTIVE, AND GAVE HIM THE GO-AHEAD FOR A MAJOR PUBLIC-WORKS PROGRAM . GEOFFREY RIPPON, 38, THE PARTY'S \" BACK-ROOM \" HOUSING EXPERT, WAS ASSIGNED TO STREAMLINE ARCHAIC BUILDING CODES AND TECHNIQUES . TWO WEEKS AGO, AS UNEMPLOYMENT KEPT RISING AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT SLUMPED TO AN ALLTIME LOW (36 PER CENT V . 45 PER CENT FOR LABOR), MACMILLAN ASSIGNED LORD HAILSHAM, HIS MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN, TO MAKE A CRASH EFFORT TO HELP THE WORST DEPRESSED AREAS AS CABINET MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NORTHEAST . THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO CALL AN ELECTION FOR 21 MONTHS . IT HAS RECENTLY SEEMED LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT MACMILLAN WOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMING FALL . BY THEN, POLITICIANS FIGURED, BRITAIN WOULD HAVE MADE HER TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S PUMP PRIMING WOULD HAVE THINNED THE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS AND REINVIGORATED THE ECONOMY .

AGAINST A DEMORALIZED, LEADERLESS OPPOSITION, THE CONSERVATIVE CHANCES ARE FAR BRIGHTER FOR THE FOURTH STRAIGHT ELECTORAL VICTORY .

A DASHING DANE WITH A NOSE FOR OPPORTUNITY AND AN EYE FOR PRETTY WOMEN, HE HAS BEEN MARRIED TWICE : FIRST TO SWEDISH ACTRESS BIRGIT TENGROTH, CURRENTLY TO DANISH MOVIE STAR HELLE VIRKNER, WHO HAS BEEN NAMED AS ONE OF EUROPE'S TEN MOST ATTRACTIVE WOMEN . IN COPENHAGEN LAST WEEK, AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE, KRAG FACED HIS SUPREME POLITICAL TEST WHEN HE INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT A COMPLEX SERIES OF MEASURES THAT WILL 1) EXTEND ALL UNION CONTRACTS FOR TWO YEARS, THUS LIMITING WAGE INCREASES ; 2) FIX MAXIMUM PRICES OF ALL CONSUMER GOODS EXCEPT FISH AND FARM PRODUCTS ; AND 3) COMPEL ALL TAXPAYERS TO BUY UP TO $290 IN 4 PER CENT BONDS THAT CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR FIVE YEARS . A TRAINED ECONOMIST, KRAG INSISTED THAT HIS DRACONIAN MEASURES ARE ESSENTIAL ; MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION IN EUROPE, DENMARK HAD STAKED ITS ECONOMIC FUTURE ON JOINING THE COMMON MARKET ALONG WITH BRITAIN . WHEN DE GAULLE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP, FRANCE'S PRESIDENT SHREWDLY PROMISED DENMARK IMMEDIATE ADMISSION . KRAG'S REPLY WAS SHARP AND TO THE POINT : \" WE HAVE NO WISH TO BE ONE OF PRESIDENT DE GAULLE'S PIECES IN THE POLITICAL CHESS GAME WITH BRITAIN . IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR TWO MAJOR CUSTOMERS, BRITAIN AND WEST GERMANY, INSIDE THE SAME ORGANIZATION . IT MUST BE OUR PURPOSE IN ALL FIELDS TO SEE THAT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A UNIFIED EUROPE GO ON . \" BUT KRAG'S LOYALTY TO HIS FRIENDS ABROAD HARDLY ALLAYED HIS HEADACHES AT HOME . RACKED BY SEVERE INFLATION, DENMARK LAST YEAR SAW ITS TRADE DEFICIT DANGEROUSLY INCREASED TO $486 MILLION, WHILE ITS CURRENCY RESERVES WERE CUT IN HALF . IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, DANISH WAGES HAVE RISEN 40 PER CENT , PRODUCTION LESS THAN 20 PER CENT . THE STRINGENT NEW ECONOMIC PROGRAM DREW ANGUISHED CRIES FROM EMPLOYERS AND THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION, BUT KRAG CURTLY REJECTED THE TRADITIONAL DANISH COMPROMISE . KRAG'S COALITION GOVERNMENT CAN UNDOUBTEDLY SQUEEZE THE BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT BY ITS USUAL ONE-VOTE MAJORITY, AND THE DANES WILL HAVE TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS FOR YEARS OF AUSTERITY AHEAD .\n",

BUT IN WESTMINSTER LAST WEEK M.P.S WERE WAGERING THAT THE TORIES WOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE THIS FALL . LABOR PARTY LEADERS EVEN CLAIMED TO KNOW THE DATE : OCT . 24, ABOUT THE LAST POSSIBLE THURSDAY (BRITAIN'S TRADITIONAL POLLING DAY) BEFORE THE END OF CAMPAIGNING SEASON . REASON FOR THE SHIFT IN THINKING WAS THE GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT CAME WITH SPRING'S THAW AFTER THE WORST WINTER OF THE CENTURY . SUDDENLY CAME WORD OF NEW EXPORT RECORDS, BOOMING RETAIL SALES AND SWELLING COMPANY PROFITS . MOST WELCOME NEWS OF ALL LAST WEEK WAS THAT THE REMORSELESS FIVE-MONTH RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT HAD FINALLY DRIFTED DOWN TO 604,000, OFF NEARLY 100,000 FROM THE MARCH FIGURE . PROMISES & THREATS . THE TORIES STILL FACED A LONG, HAZARDOUS HAUL . POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY, THE BIGGEST ROADBLOCK IS THAT INDUSTRY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND COMPETE IN WORLD MARKETS WITHOUT VIGOROUS, UNPOPULAR MEASURES TO HOLD WAGE BOOSTS TO HALF THEIR RATE OF INCREASE OVER THE PAST DECADE . ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE THAT, BY FALL, CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING'S CANNY BUDGET (TIME, APRIL 12) WILL HAVE BOOSTED PRODUCTION, WHITTLED UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUT EXTRA SPENDING MONEY IN LOWER-INCOME POCKETS . IN FACT, MANY TORY M.P.S NOW FEAR THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT WAITS UNTIL NEXT YEAR BEFORE CALLING THE ELECTION, IT MAY LOSE ITS GAINS IN ANOTHER WINTER SLUMP AND HAVE EVEN LESS TIME FOR RECOVERY BEFORE ITS FIVEYEAR MANDATE EXPIRES IN OCTOBER 1964 . IN ANY CASE, THE CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY UNDER WAY . PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN THREW A STRAW IN THE WIND BY REAPPOINTING HARDHEADED LORD POOLE AS COCHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY WITH LEADER OF THE HOUSE IAIN MACLEOD . POOLE, WHO RAISED RECORD SUMS FOR THE TORIES IN THE 1955 AND 1959 CAMPAIGNS, IS THE REPUTED AUTHOR OF THE \" NEVER-HAD-IT-SO-GOOD \" THEME THAT HELPED RETURN THE GOVERNMENT AT THE LAST ELECTION . GREY UTOPIA . LAST WEEKEND, WITH POOLE AND 32 OTHER TOP TORIES WHO WERE SUMMONED TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S COUNTRY HOME, MACMILLAN STARTED DRAFTING THE PARTY'S BROAD, LONG-TERM PROGRAM OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM . ITS THEME, SAID MACMILLAN, WILL BE \" MODERNIZE NOT NATIONALIZE . \" IN HIS FIERCEST ATTACK ON LABOR IN MANY MONTHS, THE PRIME MINISTER CHARGED IN A SPEECH TO GLASGOW TORIES THAT \" THE SOCIALISTS HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER EXCEPT OLD THREATS SUPPORTED BY SLY PROMISES . \" THE OPPOSITION, DECLARED MACMILLAN, STILL CLINGS TO ITS \" OLD-HAT \" VIEW OF A SOCIALIST UTOPIA, IN WHICH \" EVERYBODY IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME SHADE OF GREY . \" HE INSISTED THAT UNDER LABOR, BRITAIN WOULD REVERT SWIFTLY TO THE STATUS OF A \" SECONDCLASS POWER . \" MACMILLAN'S FINAL DECISION ON THE ELECTION DATE WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE GALLUP POLL PERCENTAGES, WHICH IN APRIL SHOWED A FRACTIONAL SLIP IN LABOR'S MASSIVE LEAD, NOW 49.5 PER CENT TO 34 PER CENT , OVER THE TORIES . OTHER OMENS WILL BE THE RESULTS OF THREE SPRING BY-ELECTIONS NECESSITATED BY THE DEATHS OF HUGH GAITSKELL AND TWO OTHER LABOR M.P.S . ONE THING WAS CERTAIN : AT 69, HAROLD MACMILLAN IS STILL CONFIDENT THAT THE PARTY CANNOT YET DISPENSE WITH HIS LEADERSHIP . BY WAY OF PATCHING PARTY MORALE, HE HAS ALREADY QUASHED BACK-BENCH RUMORS THAT HE MIGHT STEP DOWN . \" I'LL BE LEADING YOU INTO THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION, / HE TOLD TORY M.P.S RECENTLY, \" AND I'LL BE WITH YOU IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT . /\n",

NOT A SINGLE SOVIET REPORTER OR PHOTOGRAPHER WAS ON HAND WHEN THE MEN FROM PEKING APPEARED AT MOSCOW AIRPORT ; PRAVDA DID NOT EVEN MENTION THEIR ARRIVAL. AFTER MONTHS OF INVECTIVE, ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTERACCUSATIONS, THE GREAT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SOVIET AND CHINESE PARTY DELEGATIONS WAS FINALLY AT HAND . EAST AND WEST WATCHED THE SHOWDOWN OR WHAT COULD BE SEEN OF IT WITH EQUAL FASCINATION .  ALTHOUGH NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV SUDDENLY DISCOVERED URGENT BUSINESS IN KIEV, THE KREMLIN WAS STIFFLY CORRECT ABOUT IT ALL, SENT OUT ITS CHIEF DIALECTICIAN, LANKY, AUSTERE MIKHAIL SUSLOV, TO MEET THE VISITORS . HEAD OF PEKING'S SEVEN-MAN MISSION : TENG HSIAO-PING, SECRETARYGENERAL OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY . AS TENG STEPPED OUT OF A SOVIET TU-104 JET, A CROWD OF CHINESE RESIDENTS IN MOSCOW, WATCHED CLOSELY BY A CHINESE ARMY COLONEL, SENT UP A CHEER . SUSLOV SMILED, STEPPED FORWARD AND SHOOK TENG'S HAND . BUT THE RUSSIAN OMITTED THE USUAL BRIEF WELCOMING ADDRESS, INSTEAD POLITELY SUGGESTED THAT TENG MIGHT LIKE A TWO-HOUR REST BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS . WHEN A CHINESE DELEGATE REMARKED ON THE CHILLY 57O TEMPERATURE, A MUSCOVITE RED REPLIED : \" WE HOPE IT WILL GET WARMER . \" FRESH INSULTS. IN ONE SENSE, THINGS UNDOUBTEDLY GOT WARMER WHEN BOTH SIDES MET BEHIND THE MASSIVE WALLS OF A RARELY USED MANSION IN THE LENIN HILLS SECTION OF MOSCOW . SUSLOV AND TENG EXCHANGED TOASTS, BUT THAT WAS JUST ROUTINE . FOR UNDER THE POSE OF POLITENESS, THE SINO-SOVIET QUARREL WAS BECOMING RUDER THAN EVER . WITHOUT EXPLANATION, PEKING SUDDENLY WITHDREW ITS TWO ENTRIES FROM AN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ABOUT TO OPEN IN MOSCOW . AND JUST BEFORE THE PARTY LEADERS MET, KHRUSHCHEV AND MAO TSE-TUNG EXCHANGED A FRESH ROUND OF INSULTS OVER RED CHINA'S 25-POINT DENUNCIATION OF SOVIET POLICY . ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES REFUSED TO PUBLISH IT, MOSCOW COMPLAINED LAST WEEK THAT CHINESE AGENTS HANDED OUT THE DOCUMENT IN CITIES FROM ODESSA TO LENINGRAD AND EVEN IN THE ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTER OF DUBNA, NEAR MOSCOW. CHINESE CREWS ON THE PEKING-MOSCOW EXPRESS SCATTERED BUNDLES OF THE MANIFESTO THROUGH COACH WINDOWS, USED THE TRAIN'S PUBLIC-ADDRESS SYSTEM TO READ THE CHINESE CHARGES TO THE CAPTIVE SOVIET AUDIENCE . AFTER MOSCOW EXPELLED THREE CHINESE DIPLOMATS FOR HAVING A HAND IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY CIRCULATION CAMPAIGN, PEKING OSTENTATIOUSLY WELCOMED THEM HOME WITH BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS . AT THE SAME TIME, THE CHINESE CONDEMNED THE SOVIET MOVE AS A VIOLATION OF ITS RIGHT, AS A GOVERNMENT, TO CIRCULATE STATEMENTS ABROAD . NONSENSE, REPLIED THE SOVIETS . WHAT GAVE THE CHINESE THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD \" BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY WERE IN ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF CHINA ? \" SUCH TACTICS, FUMED THE KREMLIN, WERE PLAINLY A VIOLATION OF SOVIET SOVEREIGNTY : \" IT IS OBVIOUS THAT INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO A RAPPROCHEMENT, THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP AIMS AT AGGRAVATING DIFFERENCES . \" EQUALLY MATCHED . IF THAT WAS PEKING'S PURPOSE, IT COULD FIND NO BETTER MAN THAN TENG . SHORT, STOCKY, IN HIS 60S, TENG WAS BELIEVED BADLY CRIPPLED IN THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR, STILL HAS A LIMP AND A NERVOUS TIC WHEN HE SPEAKS WHICH DOES NOT KEEP HIM FROM SPEAKING OFTEN AND ABRASIVELY . NO STRANGER TO THE RUSSIANS, HE ATTENDED TWO PREVIOUS MOSCOW MEETINGS ON THE SPLIT IN 1957 AND IN 1960 .

IN PRESTIGE AND PERSONALITY HE IS A MATCH FOR SUSLOV, 60, WHO FOR YEARS WAS STALIN'S IDEOLOGICAL MOUTHPIECE, AND NOW SUPPLIES KHRUSHCHEV WITH THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR POLITICAL STRATEGY . INEVITABLY, WESTERN DIPLOMATS SPECULATED WHETHER THE RED CHINESE AND THE SOVIETS WOULD SEVER PARTY CONNECTIONS OR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, CARRY THE FEUD TO A SUMMIT SESSION OF WORLD COMMUNIST LEADERS, OR MERELY AGREE TO CONTINUE TO BE DISAGREEABLE .

EVEN NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, MAO'S MOST RECENT TARGET, HAS EMERGED UNSCATHED FROM PEKING'S INCESSANT BLOWS . THE ONLY THING MAO HAS DONE WITH HIS PAPER HAMMER IS TO FAN NEW HATREDS FOR HIMSELF AND HIS RED REGIME . TINY ALLIES . NOT TOO LONG AGO, RED CHINA HAD FRIENDS GALORE . MANY OF THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS OF ASIA, AND COLONIAL PEOPLES EVERYWHERE, LISTENED ADMIRINGLY TO MAO'S BOASTFUL PLANS OF A SWIFT TRANSITION FROM POVERTY TO PLENTY . THE LEFT WING IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S., DISENCHANTED WITH STALIN'S TERROR, SAW MAO AS A NEW AND NOBLER ARCHITECT OF A PEOPLES' SOCIALISM . IN THE UNITED NATIONS, IT SEEMED ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE RAMBUNCTIOUS AFRO-ASIAN VOTES OVERCAME U.S . RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF TAKING CHINA'S SEAT AWAY FROM THE NATIONALISTS ON FORMOSA AND GIVING IT TO THE COMMUNIST REGIME . BUT MAO FINDS LITTLE SYMPATHY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY . HE HAS EMBROILED HIS HARD-PRESSED COUNTRY IN SIMULTANEOUS FEUDS WITH THE U.S., THE SOVIET UNION AND INDIA, THE THREE MOST POPULOUS NATIONS IN THE WORLD AFTER HIS OWN . IN FACT, HE HAS PLUNGED CHINA INTO AN ISOLATION SO COMPLETE THAT HE CAN COUNT AS CERTAIN ALLIES ONLY TINY NORTH KOREA IN ASIA AND EVEN TINIER ALBANIA IN EUROPE . IT SEEMS LIKE SHEER LUNACY FOR MAO TO CHALLENGE THE TWO GREATEST POWERS ON EARTH AT A TIME WHEN CHINA'S INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE ARE STILL STAGGERING FROM THE DISASTERS OF THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND BEFORE HE HAS THE ARMAMENTS TO ENGAGE IN ANY LARGE-SCALE CONTEST . BUT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT MAO MAY HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK CHINA'S ECONOMIC FETTERS, AND STILL ABIDE BY HIS HARSH IDEOLOGICAL TENETS, LIES IN A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ORDER . TO THAT END HE HAS EMPHASIZED BOTH RACE AND COLOR IN HIS ATTEMPT TO WIN FRIENDS AND ALLIANCES . RED CHINA HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF ONE DAY EMPLOYING INDONESIA'S OIL, THAILAND'S RICE, EVEN JAPAN'S TECHNOLOGY, AS FUEL FOR A HUGE ASIAN ALLIANCE THAT COULD SAFELY DEFY THE WEST . AND NOW MAO HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING COLOR AS A WAY TO ALIGN THE HAVE-NOT NATIONS OF ASIA AND AFRICA AGAINST THE WEST . PANDAS & TIGERS . IT WOULD SEEM OBVIOUS THAT MAO TSE-TUNG HAS ENOUGH TROUBLE AT HOME WITHOUT LOOKING FOR IT ABROAD . THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD, LAUNCHED WITH SUCH FANFARE IN 1958, WAS INTENDED TO BRING QUICK SUCCESS IN 1) BUILDING A PURE COMMUNIST STATE, AND 2) MAKING CHINA OVER INTO A FIRST-CLASS WORLD POWER . INSTEAD, THE LEAP'S FRENZIED MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS INTO COMMUNES, THE SETTING UP OF BACKYARD BLAST FURNACES, AND THE 24-HOUR-A-DAY SPEEDUP IN THE FACTORIES NEARLY WRECKED THE NATION . TODAY, CHINA'S AGING RED LEADERSHIP (AVERAGE AGE : 63) KNOWS THAT IT WILL NEVER SEE THE PROMISED LAND, AND THAT CHINA MUST LABOR ON FOR AT LEAST A QUARTER CENTURY PERHAPS MUCH LONGER BEFORE ACCOMPLISHING THE SECOND GOAL . WHAT MANNER OF COUNTRY AND WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE MUST THE COMMUNISTS DEAL WITH IN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION ? CHINA, OF COURSE, IS ENORMOUS 14 TIMES THE SIZE OF TEXAS . IT EXTENDS 2,400 MILES FROM THE BANKS OF THE AMUR RIVER IN TOPMOST MANCHURIA TO THE TROPICAL JUNGLE BORDER WITH VIET NAM, AND 2,500 MILES ACROSS FROM THE INDENTED COAST ON THE CHINA SEA TO THE KUNLUN MOUNTAINS DEEP IN CENTRAL ASIA . INSIDE THIS VAST DOMAIN LIES JUST ABOUT EVERY VARIETY OF FLORA AND FAUNA IMAGINABLE, FROM ROLLICKING PANDAS TO PROWLING TIGERS, FROM THE INVIGORATING GINSENG ROOT TO GROVES OF THIN NANMU TREES . TO ITS PEOPLE, CHINA SIMPLY MEANS \" HERE . \" SINCE THE DAYS OF PREHISTORY, CHINA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A WORLD IN ITSELF, SEPARATED FROM OUTSIDE BARBARIANS BY THE MOST PERFECT OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS . ON THE EAST AND SOUTH IS THE PACIFIC, THE LARGEST OF OCEANS . TO THE WEST RISES THE HIGHEST PLATEAU ON EARTH . IN THE NORTH STRETCH THOUSANDS OF MILES OF DESERT ; AND HERE, TO PREVENT REPEATED INCURSIONS OF HARD-RIDING NOMADS . CHINESE EMPERORS BUILT THE 1,500-MILE GREAT WALL . REBELLION'S HOME . THOUGH UNITED BY AN ANCIENT CULTURE, CHINA HAS NEVER BEEN AS MONOLITHIC AS IT LOOKS . AN EASTWEST LINE DRAWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE VALLEYS OF THE YANGTZE AND YELLOW RIVERS DIVIDES NORTH FROM SOUTH CHINA . NORTH OF THE LINE, SUMMERS ARE SHORT AND HOT, WINTERS LONG AND BITTERLY COLD, AND THE PRINCIPAL CROPS ARE WHEAT AND MILLET . THE MEN OF NORTH CHINA ARE OFTEN AS TALL AS AMERICANS, RELATIVELY PLACID, CEREMONIAL AND SAY THE SOUTHERNERS SLOW-THINKING . SOUTH OF THE LINE, THE CLIMATE IS HOT AND HUMID, AND THE PRINCIPAL CROP IS RICE . BROKEN UP INTO VALLEYS AND SMALL PLAINS BY INNUMERABLE MOUNTAIN RANGES, THE SOUTH IS THE HOME OF INDIVIDUALISM, ANARCHY AND MYSTICAL INTROSPECTION . THE SHORTSTATURED SOUTHERNERS SPEAK A MULTITUDE OF DIALECTS, ARE COMMERCIALLY ENTERPRISING AND PERENNIALLY REBELLIOUS ALMOST EVERY CHINESE REVOLUTION HAS ORIGINATED IN THE SOUTH . PRACTICALLY ALL CHINESE CITIZENS OF THE U.S . CAME ORIGINALLY FROM A SMALL SOUTH CHINA AREA NEAR CANTON CALLED TOISHAN, WHICH IS TODAY, CURIOUSLY ENOUGH, KNOWN IN CHINA AS \" THE HOME OF VOLLEYBALL . / NATION'S BIRTHPLACE . CHINA'S 22 PROVINCES BAFFLE FOREIGNERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM SOUND ALIKE (HONAN, HUNAN ; KIANGSU, KIANGSI NSI, SHENSI) . MOST TYPICAL OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCES IS PERHAPS HOPEH, WHICH CONTAINS THE CAPITAL CITY OF PEKING . FROM ITS RUGGED BORDER WITH MANCHURIA, THE PROVINCE RUNS DOWN IN A SHELVING PLAIN TO THE SHALLOW GULF OF CHIHLI . VERY FEW EMINENT COMMUNISTS COME FROM HOPEH OR ITS NEIGHBORING PROVINCE OF SHANSI, WHICH IS NOTED FOR SACRED MOUNTAINS AND SUCH SPECTACULAR CAVE TEMPLES AS YUN KANG, WHERE A MILE-LONG CLIFF FACE HAS BEEN CHISELED INTO THOUSANDS OF BUDDHIST IMAGES . SHENSI IS REVERENCED AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE CHINESE NATION, AND WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FIRST UNIFIED BY THE CH'IN DYNASTY IN 221 B.C., ITS CAPITAL WAS NEAR PRESENT-DAY SIAN . SOUTH CHINA IS A MUCH LARGER AND MORE VARIED REGION THAN THE NORTH . THE PEOPLE OF KIANGSI ARE THE SCOTS OF CHINA AND ARE SAID TO BE CLANNISH, STINGY AND QUARRELSOME . THEY HAVE HAD LONG EXPERIENCE OF COMMUNISM AND, PRESUMABLY, FEW ILLUSIONS, SINCE THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC WAS ESTABLISHED THERE IN 1931 AND HELD OUT AGAINST THE NATIONALISTS UNTIL 1934, WHEN MAO LED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS TROOPS ON THE 8,000-MILE LONG MARCH TO YENAN IN THE NORTH . KIANGSI'S SOUND-ALIKE NEIGHBOR, KIANGSU, HAD A REPUTATION FOR VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND EASY LIVING . THE KIANGSU CITY OF SOOCHOW WAS THE SYBARIS OF OLD CHINA, AND PROSTITUTES IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TRIED TO IMITATE THE SOFT SOOCHOW DIALECT WITH ITS MUSICAL, ROUNDED VOWELS . LAND OF LEADERS . THE FRUIT-RICH PROVINCE OF SHANTUNG, HOME OF CONFUCIUS AND HIS FELLOW SAGE MENCIUS, IS INHABITED BY A STURDY PEASANTRY THAT SPEAKS A MANDARIN DIALECT SO HARSH AND UNMELODIC THAT CHINESE SAY, \" BETTER TO QUARREL WITH A MAN FROM SOOCHOW THAN TO CONVERSE CIVILLY WITH A SHANTUNGESE . \" BEAUTIFUL SZECHWAN BOASTS THAT IT GROWS ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED FIVE PROVINCES, AND IT IS FILLED WITH TERRACED HILLS, RIVERS, COAL AND VALUABLE MINERALS . ANHWEI CONTAINS THE SUGAR-LOAF MOUNTAINS AND PINNACLED ROCKS MADE FAMOUS BY THE MISTY PAINTINGS OF CHINESE ARTISTS . TO THE COMMUNISTS, THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT PROVINCES ARE THE SOUTHERN STATES OF HUNAN, CHEKIANG AND KWANGTUNG, WHICH PRODUCED MOST OF TODAY'S RED LEADERS. MAO TSE-TUNG WAS BORN NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OF CHANGSHA, AS WAS HIS NO . 2 MAN, LIU SHAO-CHI . OTHER RED HUNANESE : LABOR BOSS LI LI-SAN, ARMY COMMANDERS PENG TEH-HUAI AND LO JUNG-HUAN . KWANGTUNG, WITH ITS CAPITAL CITY OF CANTON, IS THE NERVE CENTER OF SOUTH CHINA . ITS MEN HAVE A REPUTATION FOR PUGNACITY AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, ITS WOMEN FOR SLIM, ALMONDEYED BEAUTY . WAY OUT WEST . BEYOND CHINA PROPER EXTEND VAST TERRITORIES THAT WERE CONQUERED CENTURIES AGO BUT OFTEN LIGHTLY HELD BY THE CHINESE . THE BROAD PLAINS OF MANCHURIA HAVE BECOME THE THREE PROVINCES OF KIRIN, HEILUNGKIANG, AND LIAONING . SHENYANG, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MUKDEN, IS THE PITTSBURGH OF CHINA, AND ITS STEEL MILLS ARE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE FELT-COVERED TENTS OF MANCHU HERDSMEN, WHO ARE NOW OUTNUMBERED ABOUT 30 TO 1 BY CHINESE IMMIGRANTS . AS WELL AS MOST OF GENERALISSIMO CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S UNSEATED KUOMINTANG CHIEFS . AT INNER MONGOLIA BEGINS CHINA'S FAR WEST, WHICH ALMOST EXACTLY RESEMBLES THAT OF THE U.S . PRAIRIE, DESERT AND TOWERING MOUNTAINS AND IS INHABITED BY THE CHINESE EQUIVALENT OF AMERICAN INDIANS, THE UIGHUR, KAZAKH AND KHIRGHIZ TRIBESMEN, WHO ARE DISTINCT IN RACE AND RELIGION (MOSLEM) FROM THEIR OVERLORDS . THE TRIBESMEN HAVE REPEATEDLY REBELLED AGAINST ALL CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS AND MAKE NO EXCEPTION OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME . LEAP'S LOSS . NO ONE CAN SAY WITH ACCURACY HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN CHINA'S BORDERS . THE COMMUNISTS' 1953 CENSUS SAID 582 MILLION . THE CHINESE NATIONALISTS ARGUE THAT THIS FIGURE WAS TOO HIGH ; IN FACT, SAYS THE U.S . CENSUS BUREAU, IT WAS FAR TOO LOW, AND VIRTUALLY ALL WESTERN EXPERTS AGREE . IN ANY CASE, THE U.S . STATE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT CHINA'S POPULATION IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 720 MILLION . THIS LAND AND THIS PEOPLE HAVE NOW LIVED FOR 14 YEARS UNDER THE RULE OF THE COMMUNISTS . THE GAINS HAVE BEEN CONVULSIVE : SCHOOLS BUILT AT THE SAME FRENZIED PACE AS TRACTOR PLANTS ; HOSPITALS RUSHED UP IN PROVINCES THAT HAD SCARCELY EVEN SEEN A DOCTOR ; ROADS AND RAILWAYS THROWN OVER GORGES, THROUGH MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS DESERTS . THE PACE WAS SO FAST AND FRENZIED THAT IT RESULTED IN MISMANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE LUNACY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS HAVE LOST CHINA A GOOD FIVE YEARS IN ITS REBUILDING, AND THE NATION IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE JUST ABOUT WHERE IT WAS IN 1957 IN INDUSTRY AND CROP PRODUCTION . EVEN IN 1957, SUPPLIES WERE JUST BARELY SUFFICIENT FOR NEEDS, AND SINCE THAT TIME, AT LEAST 70 MILLION MORE CHINESE HAVE BEEN BORN AND MUST BE FED, CLOTHED, HOUSED AND EDUCATED . PEKING HAS DUG INTO ITS SLENDER CASH RESERVES TO BUY WHEAT FROM ABROAD AT A TOTAL COST OF $782 MILLION . THE QUARREL WITH RUSSIA HAS BEEN EQUALLY DAMAGING . WHEN SOVIET ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS WERE ABRUPTLY CALLED HOME IN 1960, THEY NOT ONLY LEFT MANY CONSTRUCTION JOBS INCOMPLETE BUT ALSO TOOK THEIR BLUEPRINTS WITH THEM . PEKING FINDS SPARE PARTS FOR SOVIET EQUIPMENT HARD TO GET, AND MUST CANNIBALIZE SOME MACHINES TO KEEP OTHERS WORKING . MANY FACTORIES ARE NOW DEVOTED TO MAKING SPARE PARTS INSTEAD OF NEW ITEMS . HEAVY INDUSTRY HAS HAD TO GIVE WAY TO LIGHT, AND AT LEAST TWO PLANTS FORMERLY MAKING RAILROAD CARS ARE NOW TURNING OUT RUBBER-TIRED HANDCARTS AND WHEELBARROWS . IRON MONUMENTS . AGRICULTURE IS CHINA'S JUGULAR VEIN, AND THE YEAR'S CRITICAL PERIOD IS THE WINTER CROP HARVEST, WHICH TAKES PLACE IN SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER . CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT THIS YEAR'S CROP WILL FLUCTUATE AROUND THE 180-185 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN ACHIEVED LAST YEAR A GOOD BUT NOT A SENSATIONALLY GREAT HARVEST YEAR . THE COMMUNES OF THE GREAT LEAP EXIST NO LONGER EXCEPT ON PAPER, AND THE COUNTRYSIDE IS DOTTED WITH RUSTING PILLARS OF PIG IRON, MELANCHOLY MEMORIALS OF THE BACKYARD FURNACES THAT MAO THOUGHT WOULD REVITALIZE CHINA . THE TYPICAL FARM UNIT NOW IS A PRODUCTION TEAM OF 25 TO 40 FAMILIES, WHICH ARE GIVEN CONSIDERABLE AUTONOMY IN DECIDING WHAT AND WHEN TO PLANT . PRIVATE PLOTS WERE RETURNED TO THE PEASANTS IN 1961, AND ARE PRODUCING WELL FOR THE FREE MARKET . AS USUAL, THE COMMUNISTS KEEP CLOSE WATCH : THE STICK COMES DOWN IN THE FORM OF CLOSE REGULATION OF THE FREE MARKET, AND THE CARROT IS DANGLED IN THE GUARANTEES OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICES FOR CROPS SOLD TO THE STATE OVER AND ABOVE THE COMPULSORY DELIVERIES . IN THE PAST AND IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, EVERY HARVEST BECOMES A TIME OF NATIONAL BREATH HOLDING . IN A BORDERLINE ECONOMY LIKE THAT OF CHINA, ANY IMPROVEMENT IS IMMEDIATELY FELT, AND SO IS EVERY DECLINE . DOUBLE SELVES . BUT WHAT MOST THREATENS THE REGIME IS THE SQUANDERED RESERVES OF GOOD WILL AMONG MILLIONS OF CHINESE WHO HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE COMMUNISTS' DISPLAY OF STRENGTH, INCORRUPTIBILITY AND IRON DISCIPLINE . MORE THAN BY PHYSICAL LABOR, THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN WORN OUT BY MASS BRAIN-WASHING SESSIONS, PUBLIC-ACCUSATION MEETINGS, COLLECTIVE CONFESSIONS, AND ENDLESS \" STRUGGLE \" CONFERENCES IN WHICH RELAYS OF REDS UPBRAID BACKSLIDERS . AS A RESULT, HARRIED CITIZENS DEVELOP WHAT ONE EXPERT CALLS \" DOUBLE SELVES, AN OUTER, SUPERFICIAL SELF THAT CONFORMS TO COMMUNIST DEMANDS, AND AN INNER, MORAL SELF THAT REMAINS HIDDEN . \" BUT IN GENERAL, RIGID DISCIPLINE FELL AWAY WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE GREAT LEAP, AND FOOD RATIONS WERE INCREASED TO APPEASE A RESTIVE CITIZENRY . MORE RECENTLY, A NEW CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN INSTITUTED TO STAMP OUT APATHY . IT IS A MORE SOPHISTICATED PROJECT . THESE DAYS NO ONE URGES THE CITIZENRY TO COLLECT FLIES IN MATCHBOXES ; THE CRY IS : FIGHT WASTE, FIGHT CORRUPTION, FIGHT PRIVILEGE . NICE TO MOTHERS . SOME OF THE TRAPPINGS OF THE NEW PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN ARE WEIRD . IN RECENT MONTHS, NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HAVE REJOICED OVER THE BEHAVIOR OF THE / GOOD 8TH COMPANY ON NANKING ROAD, \" AN ARMY DETACHMENT ON GARRISON DUTY IN THE HEART OF WICKED SHANGHAI . THESE HEROES HAVE PRESERVED THEIR COMMUNIST PURITY FOR 14 LONG YEARS IN THE FACE OF INNUMERABLE TEMPTATIONS BY BOURGEOIS CAPITALIST DEVILS . WHEN \" PROFESSIONAL LOAFERS \" TRIED TO BRIBE THEM WITH WADS OF BANKNOTES, THE MONEY WAS SPURNED ; WHEN \" OVERDRESSED WOMEN ACCOSTED THEM ON THE STREET, THE SOLDIERS ORDERED THEM AWAY . \" ONE SOLDIER FOUND A PENNY AND PROMPTLY TURNED IT OVER TO THE COMPANY'S POLITICAL INSTRUCTOR, WHO EXPLAINED TO THE OTHERS : \" ONE CENT IS ALMOST NOTHING, BUT IF HE HAD KEPT IT, HE WOULD HAVE A SHADY SPOT IN HIS HEART . / EVEN MORE EDIFYING IS THE CASE OF 22-YEAR-OLD LEI FENG, A SQUAD LEADER IN AN ARMY TRANSPORT COMPANY STATIONED IN MANCHURIA . IN THE BAD OLD DAYS, HIS FATHER WAS BURIED ALIVE BY THE JAPANESE, HIS TWO BROTHERS STARVED TO DEATH, AND HIS MOTHER HANGED HERSELF AFTER BEING RAPED BY A LANDLORD . IN THE GOOD NEW DAYS, LEI FENG WAS ALWAYS HELPING OLD LADIES ACROSS STREETS, BUYING RAILWAY TICKETS FOR MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST THEIRS, RUSHING OUT TO DO VOLUNTEER WORK ON DIKES AND CANALS, AND DIGGING WITH HIS FINGERS WHEN HIS SHOVEL BROKE . LEI FENG DIED LAST YEAR IN AN ACCIDENT BUT, FORTUNATELY FOR THE PROPAGANDISTS, LEFT BEHIND A 200,000-WORD DIARY FILLED WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS \" I THINK MY PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO WORK FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR OTHERS, \" AND, \" I AM ALL FOR THE PARTY, SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM . \" HAILED AS THE IDEAL COMMUNIST, LEI FENG IS INTENDED TO BE THE MODEL FOR CHINESE YOUTH WHO HAVE TROUBLE IDENTIFYING WITH THE GRIZZLED VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH AND THE CIVIL WAR . IN THE PAST YEAR, AT LEAST 40 BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT LEI FENG, AND 1,000 STORYTELLERS ROAM THE VILLAGES ENTHRALLING ILLITERATE PEASANTS WITH HIS EXPLOITS AND HIS LOVE OF MAO . COLLECTING COUPONS . BUT IF LEI FENG REPRESENTS THE MYTHICAL YOUNG CHINESE, WHAT IS THE REALITY LIKE .? ONE ANSWER CAME LAST WEEK FROM A U.S . TURNCOAT, BELGIAN-BORN ALBERT BELHOMME, A FORMER G.I . WHO HAD DEFECTED TO CHINA AFTER THE KOREAN WAR . AFTER TEN YEARS IN CHINA, BELHOMME AND TWO OTHER U.S . DEFECTORS, LOWELL SKINNER AND SCOTT RUSH, BECAME POLITICALLY DISILLUSIONED AND WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY . BELHOMME SAYS THE AVERAGE WAGE AT THE PAPER FACTORY IN TSINAN WHERE HE WAS EMPLOYED WAS ABOUT $18 A MONTH . SINGLE WORKERS LIVED IN DORMITORIES WITH FOUR BUNKS TO A ROOM, FAMILIES IN ONEROOM APARTMENTS IN BLOCKS OF BRICK FLATS . DURING LUNCH BREAKS AT THE FACTORY, BELHOMME RECALLS, WORKERS \" TALKED MOSTLY ABOUT FOOD, HOW TO GET FOOD, AND PRICES . \" WHEN AN OFFICE WORKER REFERRED TO THE COMMUNIST CADRES AS \" GOLDEN BOYS, \" HIS REWARD WAS A TRIP TO A \" LABOR-EDUCATION CAMP, \" AND THEN TO JAIL . ON HIS RETURN TO THE FACTORY, HE WAS RE-EMPLOYED, BUT AS A COMMON LABORER . IN CHINA TODAY, FOOD IS PLENTIFUL IN SOME AREAS, SCARCE IN OTHERS . SO IT IS WITH ITEMS SUCH AS CLOTH . LAST YEAR, WHEN THE CLOTH RATION IN CANTON WAS ONLY 1F FEET PER PERSON ANNUALLY, IT WAS 7 FEET IN TSINAN . TO BUY COMMODITIES, WORKERS NEEDED COUPONS AS WELL AS MONEY : ONE COUPON, PLUS THE NECESSARY CASH PRICE, GOT A SMALL COOKING POT . EACH CITIZEN ALSO RECEIVED A TICKET FOR TWO BARS OF TOILET SOAP A YEAR, AND ONE OF LAUNDRY SOAP PER MONTH, AND THERE WERE RATION CARDS FOR COOKING OIL, FLOUR, SUGAR AND SWEETS . THE MEAT RATION IN TSINAN IS CURRENTLY THREE OUNCES A MONTH, AND GRAIN IS 37 POUNDS FOR MEN DOING \" MEDIUM-HEAVY \" WORK . (MOST TOWNS ALSO HAVE FREE MARKETS, AT WHICH FOOD IS AVAILABLE OFF RATION AT HIGH PRICES.) SAYS BELHOMME : / PEOPLE ARE NOT HUNGRY TODAY, BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT FULL . / THE GRIMNESS AND SCARCITY OF LIFE IN CHINA IS SOMETIMES BRIGHTENED BY EXPLOITS TESTIFYING TO THE INGENUITY AND DOGGED WORK OF ITS CITIZENS . CANADA'S DR . WILDER PENFIELD, ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP NEUROSURGEONS, RETURNED LAST WEEK FROM RED CHINA AND TOLD OF A UNIVERSITY OF SHANGHAI MEDICAL TEAM THAT BUILT A HEART-LUNG MACHINE FROM SCRATCH IN 18 MONTHS . WHEN THEY TESTED IT WITH DOGS, THE ANIMALS DIED OF AIR BUBBLES IN THE HEART . THE CHINESE WENT BACK TO WORK, GUIDED ONLY BY ARTICLES IN MEDICAL JOURNALS, AND THREE YEARS LATER CAME UP WITH A FAR BETTER MACHINE WHICH HAS NOW BEEN USED IN 60 SUCCESSFUL OPENHEART SURGICAL CASES . PLANNED BLESSINGS . CHINA'S FUTURE DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE PILLARS OF THE PARTY : THE ARMY AND THE STUDENTS . FROM ALL THREE MUST COME THE SKILLS AND DEDICATION NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE STAGGERING PROBLEMS POSED BY OVERPOPULATION AND UNDERPRODUCTION . AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID IS CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG, WHOM THE PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES TO BE OMNIPOTENT AND INCAPABLE OF MISTAKES . THE PEOPLE ARE ENDLESSLY TOLD THAT MAO IS THE SUN, THE LODESTAR, THE LIVING BUDDHA, AND HE IS SAID TO BE FAR GREATER \" THAN THE EMPTY, HYPOCRITICAL AND NEGATIVE JESUS CHRIST . \" PEASANTS ARE TAUGHT TO SING : THE SUN IS RISING IN THE EAST . CHINA HAS BROUGHT FORTH A MAO TSETUNG . HE PLANS BLESSINGS FOR THE PEOPLE . AIYAYAO, HE IS THE PEOPLES' GREAT SAVIOR ! WHATEVER THE PROPAGANDA, MAO HAS WORKED FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS WITH THE OTHER SIX MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE 19-MAN POLITBURO WITHOUT AN INTERNAL BLOODBATH A RECORD UNMATCHED BY ANY OTHER MODERN TYRANNY, COMMUNIST OR FASCIST . AMONG THIS BAND OF BROTHERS, DISSENT IS POSSIBLE YOU MAY LOSE YOUR JOB BUT NOT YOUR HEAD . ECONOMIC CHIEF CHEN YUN OPPOSED MAO'S GREAT LEAP AND IT ONLY COST HIM A TEMPORARY FALL FROM POWER . THE OTHER FIVE COMMITTEEMEN ARE HEIR APPARENT LIU SHAO-CHI (TIME, OCT . 12, 1959), PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI (TIME, MAY 10, 1954), DEFENSE MINISTER LIN PIAO, VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING AND CONGRESS CHAIRMAN CHU TEH . UNHAPPY GENERALS . THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY NOW 2,600,000 STRONG IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PRODUCT OF RED CHINA, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DISSATISFACTION AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE ARMY . AMONG THE GENERALS, THOSE HAVING A GUERRILLA MENTALITY CONFLICT WITH THE PROFESSIONALS, WHO ARGUE THAT TO OBTAIN THE SUPPLIES NEEDED BY A MODERN ARMY, CHINA MUST COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION . DEFENSE MINISTER PENG TEH-HUAI, LEADING SPOKESMAN FOR THE PROFESSIONALS, WAS DISMISSED FROM HIS POST IN 1959, BUT REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST CENTRAL COMMITTEE . THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT SERIOUSLY HAMPERS THE AIR FORCE (3,000 PLANES, HALF OF THEM OLD-FASHIONED MIG-15 FIGHTERS), WHICH HAS BEEN DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA FOR AIRCRAFT, JET FUEL AND SPARE PARTS . THE SPLIT WITH MOSCOW DOUBTLESS UPSET MANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS, AND LAST MAY THE PARTY LAUNCHED ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF ITS PERIODIC CLEANSINGS OF THE ARMED FORCES . NINETEEN NEW ARMY REGULATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED . THEIR AIM WAS TO \" PLACE THE ARMY UNDER ABSOLUTE PARTY LEADERSHIP AND TO GUARANTEE THAT THE ARMY WILL ADVANCE VICTORIOUSLY IN LINE WITH THE DIRECTIVES OF PARTY CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG . / PEKING POSTERS . RED CHINA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS BASED ON PROMOTION OF THE BEST STUDENTS AND WORK FOR THE REST OFTEN AS \" CULTURED PEASANTS \" TO RAISE THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL IN THE VILLAGES . THESE LUCKLESS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HATE THE WHOLE BUSINESS, AND THE COMMUNIST PRESS IS CAMPAIGNING TO MAKE EX-STUDENTS \" GLADLY \" ACCEPT THEIR WORK ASSIGNMENTS . ONE PAPER RECENTLY HEAPED GLORY ON THE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO SMIRKED SCARCELY AT ALL WHEN ONE OLD GRAD CAME BACK TO TAKE A JOB ON THE CAMPUS CLEANING THE TOILETS . THE SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME A CASUALTY OF THE GREAT LEAP . IN 1961-62 ENROLLMENT WAS CUT 20 PER CENT , AND THEN CUT ANOTHER 20 PER CENT THE FOLLOWING YEAR . THIS IS A DANGEROUS BUSINESS, FOR IT WAS STUDENT DISAFFECTION THAT MADE THE COMMUNISTS' TASK ALL THE EASIER IN THEIR FINAL BIG PUSH AGAINST THE KUOMINTANG . COMMUNISM'S PROBLEM, AT THIS MOMENT OF INDUSTRIAL SLOWDOWN, IS THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL JOBS, NOT OF EDUCATED PEOPLE . THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS VIEWED THE STUDENTS WITH CONSIDERABLE SUSPICION EVER SINCE THE PERIOD OF THE HUNDRED FLOWERS, WHEN STUDENT MANIFESTOS AND POSTERS DENOUNCING GOVERNMENT EXCESSES WERE SLAPPED ON EVERY SPACE AVAILABLE . SOME TATTERED BITS OF THESE INFLAMMATORY POSTERS STILL CLING TO THE WALLS AND CEILINGS AT PEKING UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAS AN ENROLLMENT OF 100,000 . AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF CHINESE REFUGEES POURING INTO HONG KONG IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL TRICKLE OF ENGINEERS AND INTELLECTUALS, FORMER BELIEVERS WHO ARE NOW DISILLUSIONED . THEY ARE NOT PARTY MEMBERS, AND THE NUMBER IS NOT LARGE ; THE SIGNIFICANCE LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT IS THE FIRST TIME SUCH COMMUNIST-EDUCATED INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN FLEEING RED CHINA . SHEAF OF SECRETS . THE SINO-SOVIET EXCHANGES ARE REACHING SUCH A POINT OF BITTERNESS THAT IN EARLIER AND SIMPLER TIMES, BOTH NATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MOBILIZING THEIR ARMIES . YET, FOR ALL THE INTEMPERATENESS OF ITS LANGUAGE, PEKING HAS BEEN NOTABLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GETTING DEEPLY INVOLVED BEYOND RED CHINA'S OWN FRONTIERS IN LINE WITH THE RED CHINESE AXIOM, \" DESPISE THE ENEMY STRATEGICALLY, BUT RESPECT HIM TACTICALLY . \" THE WEST GOT AN INSIDE LOOK AT RED CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE ON GREAT-POWER CONFLICTS BACK IN 1961, WHEN U.S . AGENTS OBTAINED POSSESSION OF A 40,000-WORD SHEAF OF SECRET BULLETINS THAT HAD BEEN ISSUED TO OFFICERS BY THE GENERAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF RED CHINA'S ARMY . IN ONE BULLETIN, LAOS WAS DESCRIBED AS AN IMPERIALIST CORK TO KEEP CHINESE INFLUENCE OUT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA . WITH TYPICAL SELF-CONCERN, THE CHINESE CALLED LAOS THE \" FOCUS \" OF THE \" WORLDWIDE ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE, \" ALTHOUGH, FOR THE RUSSIANS, BERLIN WAS FAR MORE VITAL . BUT PEKING WELCOMED THE CEASE-FIRE ORDERED BY THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS . PARTLY, THIS WAS IN LINE WITH THEIR TRADITIONAL FORMULA OF FIGHT A LITTLE, TALK A LITTLE . THE CAPTURED DOCUMENTS DISCLOSED THE MILITARY TIE-UP WITH THE 1961 SPRING OF DESPAIR AT HOME, WHEN RED CHINA FACED INTERNAL UPRISINGS, WIDESPREAD FOOD SHORTAGES, AND MORALE PROBLEMS IN THE ARMY ITSELF . SOLDIERS GRUMBLED AT CONDITIONS IN THE VILLAGES, COMPLAINING THAT \" AT PRESENT, WHAT THE FARMERS EAT IS EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT DOGS EAT, \" AND CHARGING \" VILLAGE CADRES WITH BEATING AND SCOLDING PEOPLE JUST AS IN THE OLD SOCIETY . \" PEKING WANTED NO ADDITIONAL TROUBLE IN LAOS . WHERE'S THE BOMB ? ANOTHER REASON FOR CHINESE CAUTION WAS THE GLOOMY CONVICTION THAT MOSCOW WOULD WITHHOLD HELP . WARNED A COMMUNIST GENERAL, \" IF THERE IS A WAR WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS, WE WILL HAVE TO RELY ON THE WEAPONS WE NOW HAVE . \" TODAY THE WEAPONS CHINA MOST DESPERATELY WANTS NUCLEAR WARHEADS ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT . PEKING IS SO BITTER ABOUT MOSCOW'S RENEGING ON ITS 1957 AGREEMENT TO HELP CREATE A RED CHINESE ATOM BOMB THAT IT HAS BROADCAST DETAILS OF THE RUSSIAN ABOUT-FACE . CHINESE PHYSICISTS ARE NOW BELIEVED TO BE TWO TO THREE YEARS AWAY FROM DETONATING A NUCLEAR BLAST, FARTHER STILL FROM WHAT THE EXPERTS CALL A / SIGNIFICANT CAPABILITY . \" BUT WORK PROCEEDS ON THE PROJECT, FOR PEKING HOPES THAT ACHIEVEMENT OF NUCLEAR STATUS, HOWEVER PRIMITIVE, WILL GAIN PRESTIGE AMONG THE UNDERDEVELOPED MILLIONS ON EARTH WHOSE RESPECT AND ALLIANCE THE RED CHINESE ARE OUT TO WIN . THE NOISE FROM PEKING SHOWED NO SIGN OF DIMINISHING AND CONTINUED TO FASCINATE THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD WITH FRESH TALES OF OLD SKELETONS IN COMMUNIST CLOSETS . IN ONE ANNOUNCEMENT, RED CHINA TOOK FULL CREDIT FOR FORCING A WEAK-KNEED KHRUSHCHEV ( \" WHO HAD DECIDED TO ABANDON SOCIALIST HUNGARY TO COUNTERREVOLUTION \" ) TO SEND RUSSIAN TANKS INTO BUDAPEST AND CRUSH THE 1956 UPRISING . PEKING RADIO ALSO MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED REFERENCE TO IMPORTANT FACTIONAL DISPUTES WITHIN THE TOP RANKS OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY . KHRUSHCHEV WAS ACCUSED OF OPENLY VOICING SUPPORT FOR / ANTIPARTY ELEMENTS \" IN CHINA . WESTERN EXPERTS BELIEVE THE CHINESE \" ELEMENTS \" KHRUSHCHEV WAS SUPPORTING WERE MILITARY MEN WHO OPPOSED THE GROWING SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, MOST LIKELY FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER PENG TEH-HUAI AND HIS DEPUTY, HUANG KE-CHENG . KHRUSHCHEV IS ADDITIONALLY CHARGED WITH TRYING TO SELL PEKING ON A \" TWO CHINAS \" PLAN AS A MEANS OF SETTLING MAO'S QUARREL WITH GENERALISSIMO CHIANG KAI-SHEK . PEKING RADIO ALSO CONFIRMED EARLIER REPORTS THAT RUSSIA WAS STIRRING UP THE KAZAKH TRIBESMEN IN SINKIANG AGAINST THEIR CHINESE MASTERS . ONLY LAST YEAR, RED CHINA CHARGED, RUSSIA HAD LURED SOME 10,000 KAZAKHS IN SINKIANG INTO CROSSING THE BORDER INTO SOVIET KAZAKHSTAN . DESPITE REPEATED PROTEST FROM PEKING, RUSSIA REFUSED TO GIVE BACK THE KAZAKHS AS LUDICROUS . WHETHER OR NOT RED CHINA SUCCEEDS IN ITS GREAT DESIGN TO BE LEADER OF AN AFRO-ASIAN-LATIN AMERICAN ALLIANCE, MAO TSE-TUNG WILL NOT BE AROUND TO SEE THE RESULT . AT 69, MAO NOW NEEDS HELP IN WALKING . HE DISAPPEARS FOR LONG STRETCHES, REPORTEDLY TO MEDITATE IN HIS PAVILION FACING LOVELY WEST LAKE IN HANGCHOW . NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHY HE GAVE UP THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958 AFTER ONE TERM IN OFFICE . PERHAPS IT WAS TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS KEY JOB AS HEAD OF THE PARTY . OR WAS HE PREPARING AN ORDERLY TRANSITION FOR HIS SUCCESSOR ? SO DEEP IS THE CLEAVAGE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE RESOLVED EXCEPT BY THE DEATH OR DISAPPEARANCE OF EITHER MAO OR KHRUSHCHEV . BUT, AFTER MAO, WHO ? THE IMMEDIATE SUCCESSOR IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE LIU SHAO-CHI, THE PARTY'S NO . 2 MAN . AFTER THAT, IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS . COMMENTS A CHINA EXPERT : \" FROM THE OUTSIDE, ONE CAN SEE THE FORCES THAT MUST, OR SHOULD BE, COMING TO GRIPS IN THE ARENA OF CHINA'S INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE . BUT WE CAN ONLY SEE THESE FORCES INTELLECTUALLY AND, I REPEAT, FROM THE OUTSIDE . WE CAN'T TRANSLATE THEM INTO REAL DEVELOPMENTS OR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN CHINA . \" WAITING IN THE WINGS ARE THE YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED PARTY LEADERS PRAGMATIC TECHNICIANS RATHER THAN FANATIC DOGMATISTS WHO HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED DURING THE YEARS OF OLD GUARD RULE . MAO AND THE VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH HAVE SUFFERED FEW DEATHS . BUT A SERIES OF STATE FUNERALS IS OBVIOUSLY AND ACTUARIALLY, IN THE CARDS . CHINA'S FUTURE, AND THAT OF WORLD COMMUNISM, CLEARLY DEPENDS ON WHICH EMERGENT CHINESE COMMUNISTS WILL CARRY THE COFFINS .\n",

EVIDENTLY HE HOPED TO OFFSET THE RUSSIAN SPLIT WITH RED CHINA BY GETTING CLOSER TO TITO, WITH WHOM RELATIONS EVER SINCE 1955 HAVE ALTERNATED BETWEEN FAIRLY WARM AND FAIRLY CHILLY . KHRUSHCHEV NOT ONLY SWALLOWED TITO'S DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN HIS STATUS AS A COMMUNIST \" INDEPENDENT, \" BUT IN A FOUR-DAY SESSION AT THE ISLAND RETREAT OF BRIONI PATIENTLY LISTENED TO HIS HOST'S ADVICE ON HOW TO OUTBID THE CHINESE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE RED WORLD . RED SUMMIT . ACCORDING TO PROBABLY DELIBERATE CONFERENCE LEAKS, TITO TOLD KHRUSHCHEV THAT RUSSIA MUST PLAY UP TO THE EMERGING AFRO-ASIAN NATIONS TO HALT INCREASING CHINESE PENETRATION . ADDED TITO : AS LONG AS CHINA IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE U.N . (BOTH RUSSIA AND YUGOSLAVIA FAVOR PEKING'S ADMISSION, BUT WITH WANING ENTHUSIASM), MOSCOW COULD MAKE HEADWAY BY SUPPORTING THE AFRO-ASIAN DRIVE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE U.N . SECURITY AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCILS . TITO ALSO SAID THAT RUSSIA IS BEING TOO DOCTRINAIRE IN WRITING OFF AFRO-ASIAN COUNTRIES SUCH AS SYRIA, ALGERIA, EGYPT AND IRAQ, WHICH HAVE OUTLAWED LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTIES . SINCE MOST OF THE EMERGING STATES ARE ADOPTING ONE-PARTY SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS ANYWAY, SAID TITO, THE SOVIETS SHOULD BACK THEM FOR THE TIME BEING, WORRY ABOUT PUSHING COMMUNISM LATER . TITO AND KHRUSHCHEV AGREED TO HOLD AN ANTI-CHINESE COMMUNIST SUMMIT CONFERENCE SOON, BOTH TO CONSOLIDATE RUSSIA'S POSITION IN THE CONFLICT WITH CHINA AND TO STATE FORMALLY THAT CHINESE WARMONGERING IS FAR MORE HARMFUL TO WORLD COMMUNISM THAN YUGOSLAVIA'S \" REVISIONISM . \" BUT TITO AND HIS GUEST SEEMED TO SHY AWAY FROM MUCH CLOSER RELATIONS . TITO IGNORED KHRUSHCHEV'S APPARENT DESIRE TO ADDRESS THE YUGOSLAV PARLIAMENT, AND RUSSIA COLD-SHOULDERED YUGOSLAVIA'S REQUEST FOR MASSIVE ECONOMIC AID, GRANTED BELGRADE ONLY OBSERVER STATUS IN COMECON, THE SATELLITES' MORE OR LESS COMMON MARKET . \" DIFFERENCES STILL EXIST BETWEEN US ON PARTY MATTERS, \" SAID ONE YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL . \" IF WE PRESS FOR CLOSER CONTACTS, AN OPEN QUARREL MIGHT DEVELOP . \" ON TO CUBA .

WHEN A QUESTIONER SOUGHT TO BRING OUT DISCORD BETWEEN RUSSIA AND YUGOSLAVIA BY ASKING HIM TO COMPARE LIVING STANDARDS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES (HIGHER IN YUGOSLAVIA), KHRUSHCHEV GOT ANGRY . \" WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SNIFF A SMELL FROM THE RECTUM ? \" HE SAID . \" THIS IS NOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE BODY . \" ANYWAY, KHRUSHCHEV ADDED BLISSFULLY, SOVIET RELATIONS WITH YUGOSLAVIA ARE \" ETERNAL . /\n",

EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN, AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED IN MOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATION OF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILL INEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR \" INNER CONTRADICTIONS . \" CRIED A RUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : \" THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OF STATE . \" NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONE TORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHED HIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20 YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT QUITE THIS WAY . PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE . THAT THEY DID IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 . HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES, SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT, TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE \" GRAND DESIGN, \" IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S . INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE, LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940 HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE \" STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . \" GARGANTUAN STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS . THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST, GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG . BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND 2) HAS \" SPECIAL TIES \" WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950, LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD . / MATTER OF DAYS . \" DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :. THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : \" IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR . THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE \" INSULAR, MARITIME \" BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO \" EUROPEANS \" BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S . WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE \" TROJAN HORSE \" FIRST BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING . NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF BRITAIN, GRUNTED, \" WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . \" A FRENCH DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, \" IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING . \" ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED, AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM . MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION, TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A \"MONSTROUS THING .\" DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED, HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  \"IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS,\" HE DECLARED .  \"IN REALITY, OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN . WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME, NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  \"IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED,\" HE SAID ,\"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT .\"  ADDED HEATH :\"THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS, THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF .\"  WHEN HE STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES, THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED 40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON MARKET (\"FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN,\" SAID A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME . IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT, TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, \"FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY . DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM WITHIN . SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES \"LONELY PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES .\" WHAT DISTURBS MANY AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS . DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE \"BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET .\" SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK, AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV, WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY . THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE TOLD AN AIDE, \" NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST PUSH IN EUROPE . \" THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE, AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, \" REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . \" ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST . HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN EUROPE, THE GRADUAL \" BOURGEOISATION \" OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES, WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, \" STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS . \" HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE . NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . \" AND, HE ARGUES, \" IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE . \" IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S . NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . \" I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE, BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . \" IN EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP . IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE \" COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE FREE WORLD . \" IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, \" THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . \" THE SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY . . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?\n",

      "     Preview: THERE WAS ANOTHER SWIMMING POOL IN CHRISTINE KEELER'S LIFE BEFORE THE ONE AT CLIVEDEN . AS A YOUNG GIRL, SHE WOULD OFTEN SWIM IN THE MUDDY GRAVEL PITS NEAR THE DINGY, THAMES-SIDE TOWN OF WRAYSBURY . ENVIOUS OF HER LOOKS, HER GIRL FRIENDS CALLED HER THE \" GODDESS OF THE GRAVEL PITS . \" / I REMEMBER CHRISTINE STEPPING FROM THE WATER, \" SAYS ONE CHILDHOOD CHUM . \" HER HOMEMADE BIKINI OF YELLOW JERSEY WOOL CLUNG TO HER . \" FROM MAKESHIFT BIKINIS TO PARIS ORIGINALS, THE LIFE OF CHRISTINE KEELER WAS DISCUSSED IN INTIMATE DETAIL LAST WEEK, NOT ONLY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT ALSO IN EVERY BRITISH NEWSPAPER . FOR ALL THE SENTIMENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CLICHES ABOUT A PRETTY CHILD FROM A BROKEN HOME, WHAT EMERGED WAS A CIRCEAN ODYSSEY OF A GIRL WHO ALWAYS KNEW WHAT SHE AND WHAT MEN WANTED . BRIGHT LIGHTS . HER PARENTS SPLIT UP WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD . WITH HER MOTHER, CHRISTINE MOVED INTO A CONVERTED BUS COACH NEAR THE THAMES THAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A SHANTY ON WHEELS . EVEN THEN, CHRISTINE'S EYE WAS ON THE MAIN CHANCE . OFTEN SHE WOULD CLIMB UP ON THE KNEE OF A NEIGHBOR AND BEG TO BE TOLD ABOUT THE BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE BIG CITIES . \" SHE WAS FOREVER ASKING ME TO TELL HER STORIES ABOUT LIFE IN LONDON, \" RECALLS THE NEIGHBOR . / I SPENT HOURS TELLING HER ABOUT HER DREAMLAND . \" CHRISTINE EVENTUALLY TOOK A JOB IN A LONDON DRESS HOUSE . AT A SMALL SOHO CAFE CALLED THE ZODIAC, SHE MET A SPANISH WAITER NAMED CARLO, BEGAN SPENDING WEEKENDS WITH HIM AT HIS SEEDY SOHO BOARDINGHOUSE . THEN A GIRL FRIEND INTRODUCED HER TO A U.S . AIR FORCE SERGEANT . \" NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE WHOOPED IT UP WITH THE YANKS, \" RECALLS THE FRIEND . \" THEY WERE TWELVE VERY GAY MONTHS . \" BUT CHRISTINE GOT PREGNANT, GAVE BIRTH PREMATURELY TO A SON SHE CALLED PETER . THE INFANT DIED SIX DAYS LATER . CHRISTINE WAS JUST 17 . OUT OF WORK AND SHORT OF CASH, CHRISTINE BECAME THE MISTRESS OF A RICH ROLLSROYCE-DRIVING REAL ESTATE MAN, WHO SET HER UP IN A LUXURIOUS FLAT OFF BAKER STREET . BUT THE AFFAIR PROVED UNSATISFACTORY, AND SHE WENT TO WORK AS A WAITRESS, THEN AS A SHOWGIRL IN MURRAY'S CABARET CLUB . \" AND THEN, \" CHRISTINE SAID, / I BEGAN MEETING MY FIRST INTERESTING MALE COMPANIONS . / NO MAN'S COLLAR . ONE WAS STEPHEN WARD, AND A FEW MONTHS AFTER THEY MET IN 1959, CHRISTINE MOVED INTO HIS FLAT IN WIMPOLE MEWS . \" IT WAS A SORT OF BROTHER-AND-SISTER RELATIONSHIP, \" SAID CHRISTINE, \" NOTHING ELSE . \" A FEATURE OF WARD'S APARTMENT WAS A ONE-WAY MIRROR PERMITTING OBSERVATION OF THE BEDROOM FROM THE LIVING ROOM ; THIS ELABORATE PEEPHOLE WAS COVERED BY A PICTURE OF BUDDHA WHEN NOT IN USE . \" THAT WAS INSTALLED BY AN OLD ECCENTRIC WHO USED TO OWN THIS PLACE, \" WARD SAID . \" I'M GOING TO HAVE IT FILLED IN . \" AN ELABORATE PRACTICAL JOKER, WARD OFTEN PUT A DOG COLLAR AROUND CHRISTINE'S NECK AND LED HER AROUND LONDON ON A LEASH . SOMETIMES CHRISTINE RECEIVED GUESTS WEARING NOTHING BUT SKINTIGHT BLUE JEANS, ONCE GAVE A PARTY AT WHICH ALL THE GUESTS SAT DRINKING CHAMPAGNE IN HER BATHROOM . ONE OF HER THIRSTIEST FRIENDS WAS EVGENY IVANOV . THOUGH HE WAS A BIT OF A PRIG, IVANOV WAS A DEVOTED READER OF THE STEAMY JAMES BOND NOVELS, FOUND THEM AMUSING BUT RIDICULOUS . \" HE PROFESSED TO DISLIKE LOOSE WOMEN, DID NOT LIKE CHRISTINE EVEN TO USE COSMETICS . BUT ONE HOT JULY NIGHT, RECALLS CHRISTINE, IVANOV FINALLY \" CAME TO FORSAKE ALL HIS PRINCIPLES AND HIS PRIDE . SUDDENLY HE WAS KISSING ME, ROLLING HIS DARK CURLS INTO MY NECK . . . \" AFTERWARD, IVANOV WAS \" SAD, VERY SAD . \" CHARMING BUT WARY . THAT VERY SAME WEEKEND CHRISTINE HAD MET JACK PROFUMO FOR THE FIRST TIMES AT CLIVEDEN, AND CHRISTINE, WHO WAS VISITING WARD AT HIS COTTAGE ON THE GROUNDS, WAS STEALING A NUDE MOONLIGHT SWIM IN ASTOR'S POOL . SUDDENY BILL ASTOR APPEARED WITH SOME GUESTS, INCLUDING PROFUMO . FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING A TOWEL AROUND HER DRIPPING SELF, CHRISTINE WAS INTRODUCED TO BOTH JACK AND HIS WIFE, VALERIE HOBSON . \" SHE WAS VERY CHARMING, \" SAID CHRISTINE, \" BUT SEEMED WARY OF ME . \" NEXT DAY, CHRISTINE BROUGHT IVANOV OUT TO CLIVEDEN, AND THE RUSSIAN AND PROFUMO HELD A SWIMMING RACE, WHICH JACK ONLY WON BY CHEATING . \" THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO TRUST THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, \" PROFUMO TOLD IVANOV . LATER THAT SAME DAY, HE ASKED CHRISTINE FOR HER TELEPHONE NUMBER ; SHE TOLD HIM TO GET IT FROM WARD . JACK AND CHRISTINE MET SEVERAL TIMES IN WARD'S FLAT . \" MENTALLY, WE BECAME VERY CLOSE, \" SAID CHRISTINE . IT HAPPENED, JUST LIKE IT HAPPENED WITH IVANOV . AT LEAST THAT IS HOW CHRISTINE TOLD IT IN THE NEWS OF THE WORLD : \" THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE ELECTRIC, POTENT SILENCES, AND HE WAS KISSING ME AND I WAS RETURNING HIS KISSES WITH EVERYTHING I SUDDENLY FELT FOR HIM . \" ONCE, WHEN VALERIE WAS IN IRELAND ON HOLIDAY, PROFUMO TOOK CHRISTINE TO HIS HOUSE IN REGENT'S PARK . \" WE CREPT AROUND THE LOVELY ROOMS AND THEN WE GOT TO THEIR BEDROOM . \" MARVELLOUS PLACE .

NAUGHTY QUESTIONS . THE BRITISH APPROVE OF ITS PRIMARY AIM, TO SATISFY WEST GERMANY'S DEMAND FOR A BIGGER ROLE IN NATO'S NUCLEAR DEFENSE, BUT ARGUE THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO BUILD THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET AND CONTRIBUTE AS WELL TO MLF, WHOSE 20 TO 25 SHIPS ARE EXPECTED TO COST $5 BILLION OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD . THANKS TO WASHINGTON'S SUCCESS IN SELLING MLF TO GERMANY AND THEN TO ITALY, IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS IF THE FLEET MIGHT BE BUILT WITH ONLY A TOKEN CONTRIBUTION FROM BRITAIN . HOWEVER, WHEN ALDO MORO TOOK OVER AS ITALY'S PREMIER-DESIGNATE LAST MONTH, WASHINGTON REALIZED THAT HIS FRAGILE GOVERNMENT IS IN NO POSITION TO HONOR ITS COMMITMENT TO SHOULDER MLF'S COST, OR EVEN TO PARTICIPATE . THUS THE U.S ., WHICH HAS PROMISED TO CONTRIBUTE 40 PER CENT, AND PERSUADED THE GERMANS TO PLEDGE ANOTHER 40 PER CENT , HAS FINALLY PUT PRESSURE ON BRITAIN . TO WHITEHALL'S DISMAY, WASHINGTON ANNOUNCED ITS TOP MLF EXPERT, ADMIRAL CLAUDE RICKETTS, DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, WOULD FLY TO LONDON THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT'S TECHNICAL RESERVATIONS AND SATISFY BRITISH COMPLAINTS THAT THEY HAVE SO FAR RECEIVED NOTHING BUT \" COMPUTER ANSWERS \" FROM THE PENTAGON .

EITHER THE PROJECT WILL BE ABANDONED, WITH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE GERMANS AND OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS WILL ULTIMATELY DEVELOP THEIR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS ; OR THE FORCE WILL COME INTO BEING ANYWAY, AND IN TIME MAY DEVELOP INTO A TRULY EUROPEAN DETERRENT, EXCLUSIVE OF BRITAIN .

IN COPENHAGEN LAST WEEK, AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE, KRAG FACED HIS SUPREME POLITICAL TEST WHEN HE INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT A COMPLEX SERIES OF MEASURES THAT WILL 1) EXTEND ALL UNION CONTRACTS FOR TWO YEARS, THUS LIMITING WAGE INCREASES ; 2) FIX MAXIMUM PRICES OF ALL CONSUMER GOODS EXCEPT FISH AND FARM PRODUCTS ; AND 3) COMPEL ALL TAXPAYERS TO BUY UP TO $290 IN 4 PER CENT BONDS THAT CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR FIVE YEARS . A TRAINED ECONOMIST, KRAG INSISTED THAT HIS DRACONIAN MEASURES ARE ESSENTIAL ; MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION IN EUROPE, DENMARK HAD STAKED ITS ECONOMIC FUTURE ON JOINING THE COMMON MARKET ALONG WITH BRITAIN . WHEN DE GAULLE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP, FRANCE'S PRESIDENT SHREWDLY PROMISED DENMARK IMMEDIATE ADMISSION . KRAG'S REPLY WAS SHARP AND TO THE POINT : \" WE HAVE NO WISH TO BE ONE OF PRESIDENT DE GAULLE'S PIECES IN THE POLITICAL CHESS GAME WITH BRITAIN .

OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, ON HIS OWN PEOPLE AND ON THEIR NEIGHBORS, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS PERFECTED HIS NATIVE TALENT FOR HANDING OUT RUDE SURPRISES . EMPLOYING THE LOFTY DISDAIN THAT USED TO INFURIATE ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN, DE GAULLE SUCCEEDED IN INFURIATING KENNEDY, MACMILLAN AND A HOST OF OTHERS BY VETOING BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENTLE ABOUT IT, ALLOWING NEGOTIATIONS TO SPUTTER OUT IN A CONFUSION OF DETAILS . HE CHOSE TO BE BLUNT AND HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO SHUT OUT BRITAIN OR MERELY TO HUMILIATE HER . HE ALSO SHOOK THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE TO ITS ROOTS, SET OUT TO CONTEST ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO PUT IN QUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE U.S . IN EUROPE . FOR THE WEST ! HE CREATED A DRAMATIC HISTORICAL TURN, AN OBSCURE DESTINATION . DEAD MECHANISM . WESTERN EUROPE HEARD THE NEWS WITH ANGER AND DISMAY . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD BLAMED DE GAULLE FOR A \" BLACK DAY, \" DECLARING THAT \" THE COMMON MARKET IS NOW ONLY A MECHANISM AND NO LONGER A LIVING THING . \" ALFRED MULLERARMACK, WEST GERMANY'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR AT BRUSSELS, QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST . JEAN MONNET, THE DYNAMIC OPTIMIST WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE COMMON MARKET, LAMENTED THAT \" THERE NOW LOOMS DISUNION WITH ITS INHERENT DANGERS . \" BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN TOLD HIS COUNTRY ON TV : \" WHAT HAPPENED AT BRUSSELS WAS BAD . BAD FOR US, BAD FOR EUROPE, BAD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD . \" , \" BRUTAL \" WAS THE WORD HEARD MOST OFTEN IN WHITEHALL AND AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO DESCRIBE DE GAULLE'S BEHAVIOR . ARCHITECT OR AT LEAST CO-DESIGNERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, U.S . POLICYMAKERS WERE PLUNGED INTO GLOOM . \" MOST UNFORTUNATE, \" SAID THE STATE DEPARTMENT . IN CONGRESS THERE WERE REVIVED MUTTERINGS ABOUT THE INEFFICACY OF FOREIGN AID AND THE INGRATITUDE OF ALLIES . ARKANSAS' SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT TALKED OF THE \" TEMPORARY ABERRATION \" OF THE MAN . A NATION THAT HAD HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO PROFIT FROM THE COMMUNIST SPLIT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND RED CHINA FOUND A DEEP CREVICE OPENING AT ITS FEET . AND THOUGH THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SPEAK OF AN \" AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL \" OF ITS RELATIONS WITH A RECALCITRANT FRANCE AS JOHN FOSTER DULLES ONCE HAD U.S . MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC POLICY TOWARD EUROPE WAS PLAINLY IN NEED OF ONE . COMMUNITY TWILIGHT . EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN, AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED IN MOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATION OF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILL INEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR \" INNER CONTRADICTIONS . \" CRIED A RUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : \" THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OF STATE . \" NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONE TORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHED HIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20 YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT QUITE THIS WAY . PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE . THAT THEY DID IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 . HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES, SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT, TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE \" GRAND DESIGN, \" IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S . INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE, LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940 HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE \" STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . \" GARGANTUAN STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS . THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST, GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG . BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND 2) HAS \" SPECIAL TIES \" WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950, LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD . / MATTER OF DAYS . \" DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :. THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : \" IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR . THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE \" INSULAR, MARITIME \" BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO \" EUROPEANS \" BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S . WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE \" TROJAN HORSE \" FIRST BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING . NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF BRITAIN, GRUNTED, \" WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . \" A FRENCH DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, \" IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING . \" ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED, AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM . MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION, TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A \"MONSTROUS THING .\" DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED, HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  \"IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS,\" HE DECLARED .  \"IN REALITY, OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN . WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME, NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  \"IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED,\" HE SAID ,\"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT .\"  ADDED HEATH :\"THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS, THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF .\"  WHEN HE STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES, THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED 40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON MARKET (\"FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN,\" SAID A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME . IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT, TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, \"FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY . DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM WITHIN . SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES \"LONELY PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES .\" WHAT DISTURBS MANY AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS . DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE \"BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET .\" SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK, AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV, WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY . THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE TOLD AN AIDE, \" NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST PUSH IN EUROPE . \" THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE, AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, \" REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . \" ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST . HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN EUROPE, THE GRADUAL \" BOURGEOISATION \" OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES, WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, \" STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS . \" HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE . NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . \" AND, HE ARGUES, \" IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE . \" IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S . NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . \" I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE, BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . \" IN EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP . IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE \" COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE FREE WORLD . \" IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, \" THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . \" THE SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY . . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?\n",

      "     Preview: GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY ? SHOUTED THE DAILY MIRROR . AS IF ANYONE DIDN'T KNOW . WHAT WENT ON WAS JUST THE KIND OF STORY ON WHICH THE MIRROR THRIVES . ALTHOUGH IT HAD STARTED OUT MERELY AS VENERY IN HIGH (AND SEVERAL LOW) PLACES, IT GREW INTO A MAJOR SCANDAL THAT NOT ONLY SMASHED THE CAREER OF A PROMISING TORY POLITICIAN, BUT ALSO RAISED SOME TROUBLING QUESTIONS ABOUT BRITISH SECURITY AND ROCKED THE MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT . OTHERWISE, IT READ LIKE LA DOLCE VITA, ANGLO-SAXON STYLE . THE STORY FIRST EMERGED PARTIALLY LAST MARCH, WHEN ITS LEADING CHARACTERS BECAME PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED : RED-HAIRED CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO CAME FROM MIDDLESEX TO SLING HASH AT 17, AND AT 21 WAS THE WEST END'S MOST-CALLED GIRL ; JOHN PROFUMO, 48, THE ABLE WAR MINISTER AND MAN-ABOUT-MAYFAIR, WHOSE VIRILE CHARM PROVED SOMETHING OF A TORY ASSET AFTER THOSE HOMOSEXUAL SPY SCANDALS ,; AND DR . STEPHEN WARD, 43, A SOCIAL OSTEOPATH (AND SON OF THE ANGLICAN CANON OF ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL), WHO SAID HE LIKED HELPING ATTRACTIVE GIRLS OF HUMBLE BIRTH ADAPT TO \" THE NEEDS AND STRESSES OF MODERN LIVING . \" AFTER MONTHS OF RUMOR, A LABOR M.P . CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT TO DENY THE RUMORS OF A MINISTER'S INDISCRETIONS WITH CHRISTINE . PROFUMO'S FIRM DENIAL OF WRONGDOING, AND A DEMONSTRATION OF SUPPORT FROM PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN, QUASHED THE STORY TEMPORARILY UNTIL IT BURST FORTH AGAIN LAST WEEK . THIS TIME PROFUMO RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AFTER AN ABRUPT, ABJECT CONFESSION THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIED TO THE PRIME MINISTER, HIS COLLEAGUES AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS . COEXISTENCE . OF NOBLE ITALIAN DESCENT, JOHN DENNIS PROFUMO HAD EVERY QUALIFICATION TO REACH THE TORIES' TOP RANKS : HARROW AND OXFORD, FINE WAR RECORD, BRAINS, DRIVE, AND A BEAUTIFUL WIFE, MOVIE ACTRESS VALERIE (GREAT EXPECTATIONS) HOBSON . TOGETHER, THE PROFUMOS WERE WEEKENDING AT CLIVEDEN, FAMED COUNTRY ESTATE OF LORD AND LADY ASTOR, WHEN THEY WERE INTRODUCED TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 . ALSO PRESENT : STEPHEN WARD, WHO HAD A COTTAGE ON THE PLACE . THEREAFTER, VALERIE STAYED HOME WHILE JACK VISITED CHRISTINE AT WARD'S FLAT IN WIMPOLE MEWS . WHAT THE WAR MINISTER NEVER KNEW WAS THAT CHRISTINE HAD ANOTHER REGULAR VISITOR, EVGENY IVANOV, WHO WAS A SOVIET NAVAL ATTACHE IN LONDON . A ROUND-EYED OBSERVER OF THEIR COEXISTENCE WAS NYMPHET MARILYN ( \" MANDY \" ) RICE-DAVIES, A WELL-DEVELOPED 16-YEAR-OLD, WHO WAS ONE OF CHRISTINE'S INTIMATES . \" THE FARCICAL THING ABOUT IT ALL, \" AS MANDY TOLD THE PRESS, \" WAS THAT, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, AS JACK LEFT CHRISTINE AT THE FLAT, IVANOV WALKED IN . \" IT POSSIBLY SEEMED LESS HILARIOUS TO BRITISH MI-5 INTELLIGENCE AGENTS, WHO WERE SHADOWING IVANOV AT THE TIME, TO FIND THAT THEIR WAR MINISTER WAS UNWITTINGLY SHARING A BED WITH A SUSPECTED SOVIET SPY . THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE THOUGH THEY TRIED NOT TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC, PROFUMO SOMETIMES TOOK CHRISTINE FOR DRIVES, SHE LATER RECALLED . \" HE SHOWED ME THE WAR OFFICE, WHERE HE WORKED . HE EVEN SHOWED ME DOWNING STREET . \" BUT IN TIME PROFUMO STOPPED SEEING CHRISTINE BECAUSE, SHE EXPLAINED, HE WAS \" SCARED IT WOULD RUIN HIS CAREER . \" COMRADE IVANOV WAS SHIPPED OFF TO MOSCOW, AND THE \" MODEL \" FROM MIDDLESEX, WHO HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR JAZZ ON THE WAY UP, HIT THE BLUES BELT AND ACQUIRED A JAMAICAN LOVER NAMED JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE . BUT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HER TELEPHONE WAS FOR . \" HE SEEMED TO THINK, \" CHRISTINE COMPLAINED LATER, \" THAT I WAS GOING TO LIVE WITH HIM FOREVER . \" ONE DAY, JOHNNIE SHOWED UP WITH A GUN AND FIRED SEVERAL BULLETS INTO THE DOOR BEFORE THE BOBBIES BAGGED HIM . MULTIRACIALISM . AFTER JOHNNIE WENT TO JAIL, THERE WAS ANOTHER WEST INDIAN LOVER, ALOYSIUS \" LUCKY \" GORDON, WHO, IF ANYTHING, WAS EVEN MORE NARROWMINDED . IN APRIL HE BEAT HER UP . LAST WEEK, AT HIS TRIAL FOR ASSAULT, ALOYSIUS WAS SO UNGALLANT AS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAD KEPT HER SUPPLIED WITH MARIJUANA, WHILE ALL SHE GAVE HIM IN RETURN WAS VD . \" YOU CAN SAY THIS FOR CHRISTINE, \" SAID A LEADING LABOR POLITICIAN . \" AT LEAST SHE'S MULTIRACIAL . \" THE SCANDAL MIGHT HAVE DIED, HAD IT NOT BEEN RESURRECTED BY STEPHEN WARD HIMSELF . SEVEN WEEKS AFTER PROFUMO'S DENIAL, HE TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE SECRETARY THAT THE WAR MINISTER HAD LIED IN COMMONS, THAT HE HAD INDEED HAD AN AFFAIR WITH CHRISTINE KEELER . WARD REPEATED HIS CHARGES IN LETTERS TO HOME SECRETARY HENRY BROOKE AND LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON . PROFUMO WAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS NEW ACCUSATION, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT HE STARTLED TORY OFFICIALS BY BLURTING THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTINE IN A LETTER TO THE VACATIONING PRIME MINISTER, PROFUMO RESIGNED AS WAR MINISTER AND AS M.P . FOR STRATFORD-ON-AVON, CONFESSING HIS \" GRAVE MISDEMEANOR . \" SAID HE : \" I CANNOT TELL YOU OF MY DEEP REMORSE . \" MACMILLAN ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION, DESCRIBING THE AFFAIR AS \" A GREAT TRAGEDY . \" THEN PROFUMO AND HIS WIFE LEFT THEIR REGENT'S PARK HOME AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE COUNTRY . DILEMMA . THE SCANDAL HE LEFT BEHIND GOT LIVELIER EVERY DAY . CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO WAS BACK FROM A CONTINENTAL HOLIDAY AND SUDDENLY SPORTED A \" BUSINESS MANAGER \" AND A NEW ROLLS-ROYCE, ADDED MORE OFF-COLOR TO THE SAGA BY TELLING AND SELLING HER STORY TO THE PAPERS . \" I WAS VERY FOND OF JACK, \" SHE SAID WISTFULLY . \" IF EVER WE MEET AGAIN, WE HAVE AT LEAST THIS IN COMMON BOTH OUR CAREERS HAVE BEEN RUINED . \" MANDY CHIMED IN WITH DETAILS OF THE HIGH LIVING THAT HAD EARNED HER A JAGUAR, MINK AND DIAMONDS BY HER 17TH BIRTHDAY . AT ONE DINNER PARTY, SHE RECALLED, \" A NAKED MAN WEARING A MASK WAITED ON TABLE LIKE A SLAVE . HE HAD TO HAVE A MASK BECAUSE HE WAS SO WELL KNOWN . / MEANWHILE STEPHEN WARD'S EXPLANATIONS FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS AND TV SCREENS . THE AFFAIR, HE PROTESTED, HAD GIVEN RISE TO \" A WHOLE TRAIN OF RUMORS, AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WERE MENTIONED, WITH THE IMPLICATION THAT I'D BEEN TRYING TO PROCURE THEM FOR MISS KEELER . \" DESPITE HIS SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO PROTECT PROFUMO AND THE GOVERNMENT, SAID WARD, HE HAD REPORTED PROFUMO'S LIAISON TO BRITISH INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT IN 1961 . SAID HE : \" I'VE ALMOST HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN . IT'S A TERRIBLE DILEMMA . ONE DIDN'T WANT TO BITCH UP ANYBODY . YOU OWE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS . BUT I MUST CLEAR MYSELF . \" FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, STEPHEN WARD WILL DO HIS EXPLAINING IN COURT . AT WEEK'S END SCOTLAND YARD PLUCKED THE OSTEOPATH FROM HIS WHITE JAGUAR SPORTS CAR AND JAILED HIM ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING BRITAIN'S SEXUAL OFFENSES ACT BY / LIVING WHOLLY OR IN PART ON THE EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTION . \" UNREST . AS A MATTER OF POLITICAL TACTICS, THE LABOR PARTY DECIDED TO TREAT THE PROFUMO AFFAIR NOT SO MUCH AS A MORAL INDICTMENT OF UPPERCRUST BRITAIN BUT RATHER AS ANOTHER FLAGRANT EXAMPLE OF THE ERRATIC WORKINGS OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM . IF, ARGUED LABORITES, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT BRITAIN'S WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED A CALL GIRL WITH A SOVIET AGENT, WHY WAS NOTHING DONE TO BREAK UP A LIAISON THAT MIGHT EXPOSE HIM TO RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL ? WAS MACMILLAN TOLD ? IF SO, HAD THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED PROFUMO TO LIE ABOUT HIS DALLIANCE WITH CHRISTINE KEELER SOLELY IN ORDER TO AVERT A DAMAGING SCANDAL ? UNFLAPPABLE HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO DID NOT ALLOW LAST WEEK'S EVENTS TO INTERRUPT HIS GOLFING VACATION, WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE WHEN PARLIAMENT RECONVENES NEXT WEEK . HE MAY YET, AS IN THE PAST, CONFOUND HIS CRITICS IN COMMONS . BUT THE AFFAIR MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE TORIES' ALREADY SHAKY CHANCES AT THE NEXT ELECTIONS, WHICH MACMILLAN WILL NOW PROBABLY TRY TO DELAY . SAID TORY BACKBENCHER LORD LAMBTON : \" THE HARM THIS WILL DO TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL BE ENORMOUS . THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME A GENERAL FEELING OF UNREST IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO THE MORALITY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT . THIS FEELING WILL BE IMMENSELY INCREASED . /\n",

      "     Preview: CLOCK TICKED TOWARD STARTING TIME FOR THE GREAT DEBATE, THERE WERE ONLY TWO EMPTY SEATS IN THE JAMMED, EXPECTANT CHAMBER . THE FIRST WAS FILLED, WITH FOUR MINUTES TO SPARE, BY HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO SAT DOWN STIFFLY ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH, LOOKING AS CHILL AND WAN AS HIS EFFIGY AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S . TWO MINUTES LATER, A SHORT, PLUMP MAN IN A SHABBY GREY SUIT BUSTLED EXPRESSIONLESSLY DOWN THE GANGWAY, SANK INTO THE OPPOSITION FRONT BENCH FACING MACMILLAN, AND FINGERED A CARDBOARD FILE . AS THE CLOCK STRUCK, LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON ROSE TO HIS FEET AND FOR A SECOND SAVORED THE TINGLING SILENCE BEFORE BREAKING IT WITH HIS FLAT NASAL YORKSHIRE VOICE . \" THIS IS A DEBATE, \" HE BEGAN, \" WITHOUT PRECEDENCE IN THE ANNALS OF THE HOUSE . \" THE TWO MEN WERE THE PRODUCTS OF TWO REMARKABLE POLITICAL CAREERS AND ALSO OF TWO BRITAINS : MACMILLAN, THE SKILLFUL, COURAGEOUS AND OFTEN RUTHLESS PATRICIAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIS COUNTRY FROM THE DEBRIS OF SUEZ AND LED IT INTO AN ERA OF UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY ; HAROLD WILSON, THE DRY, DILIGENT AND OFTEN DEVIOUS SON OF A PROVINCIAL CHEMIST WHO HAD RISEN BY HARD WORK AND CHANCE (INCLUDING THE DEATH OF THE MAN HE SUCCEEDED, HUGH GAITSKELL) TO THE TOP OF THE LABOR PARTY . AS HE FACED MACMILLAN, WHO HAD GONE TO OXFORD BY FAMILY TRADITION, HAROLD WILSON, WHO HAD GONE TO OXFORD ON A SCHOLARSHIP, STROVE TO EMBODY A NEW, IMPATIENT, CLASS-DEFYING ENGLAND . THE MORAL DECAY SURROUNDING THE PROFUMO AFFAIR, HE TRIED HARD TO SUGGEST, MUST BE BLAMED ON THE TORIES . REFERRING TO CHRISTINE KEELER'S REPORTED $14,000-A-WEEK NIGHTCLUB CONTRACT, WILSON DECLARED : \" THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY NAUSEATING ABOUT A SYSTEM OF SOCIETY WHICH PAYS A HARLOT 25 TIMES AS MUCH AS IT PAYS ITS PRIME MINISTER . \" FOR THE REST, HAROLD WILSON STUCK TO THE SECURITY ISSUE AND THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE PROFUMO CASE, WHICH HE ATTACKED AS EITHER DISHONEST OR INCOMPETENT, OR BOTH . LET DOWN . THE ONCE UNFLAPPABLE MACMILLAN FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT AND KEPT DABBING AT THE POUCHES BENEATH HIS EYES WITH A CRUMPLED HANDKERCHIEF . WHEN HE ROSE, HE OPENLY PLAYED FOR THE SYMPATHY OF HIS COLLEAGUES . \" WHAT HAS HAPPENED, \" HE SAID, \" HAS INFLICTED A DEEP, BITTER AND LASTING WOUND ON ME . \" ESSENTIALLY HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN GROSSLY DECEIVED BY PROFUMO AN \" ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE \" CULPRIT AND BADLY LET DOWN BY HIS SUBORDINATES, WHO FAILED TO KEEP HIM INFORMED . FROM THE BACK BENCHES CAME A RUDE GIBE OF \" NOBODY EVER TELLS ME NUFFIN ! \" BY THE TIME MACMILLAN FINISHED, THE HOUSE WAS PREPARED TO ACQUIT HIM OF PERSONAL DISHONESTY AND MORAL TURPITUDE, BUT HE HAD CONVICTED HIMSELF OF NEGLIGENCE AND NAIVETE OR PERHAPS SIMPLY OF A FATAL ABILITY TO AVERT HIS EYES FROM WHAT HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE . IN THE VOTE FOLLOWING THE DEBATE, 27 CONSERVATIVES VOTED AGAINST MACMILLAN OR ABSTAINED . ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE CRIES OF \" RESIGN, RESIGN, \" AND THIS IS WHAT MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO THE ONLY REMAINING QUESTION BEING WHEN . THE WARNING . THE LONG DEBATE SERVED TO FIX GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY, OR THE LACK OF IT, AND ILLUSTRATED THE ODD NATURE OF THE BRITISH SECURITY SYSTEM, COMPOUNDED OF SHREWDNESS, INEFFICIENCY, AND AN OFTEN MISGUIDED SENSE OF SPORTSMANSHIP THAT GOES TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS IN PROTECTING MEMBERS OF THE CLUB . THE CASE, AS IT EMERGED FROM THE DEBATE, FALLS INTO FOUR PHASES . FIRST, THERE WAS THE CHRISTINE-PROFUMO AFFAIR ITSELF, WHICH, ACCORDING TO PROFUMO, LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS, FROM JULY TO DECEMBER 1961, BUT BY OTHER EVIDENCE POSSIBLY LASTED LONGER . DURING THOSE SAME MONTHS, CHRISTINE ALSO ENTERTAINED RUSSIAN ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV, WHO HAD BEEN PALS FOR SOME TIME WITH HER MENTOR, DR . STEPHEN WARD . MI-5, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE, APPARENTLY DISCOVERED ONLY HALF OF WHAT WILSON SCATHINGLY CALLED \" THIS DINGY QUADRILATERAL . \" IN AUGUST 1961, ACCORDING TO THE COMMONS DEBATE, CABINET SECRETARY SIR NORMAN BROOK WARNED PROFUMO THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE SECRETARY FOR WAR NOT TO BE TOO FRIENDLY WITH WARD ; HE DID NOT MENTION, AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, CHRISTINE . NOTHING OF THIS WAS REPORTED TO MACMILLAN . IN THE SECOND PHASE, WHICH COVERS MOST OF 1962, RUMORS OF THE AFFAIR KEPT REACHING THE NEWSPAPERS, TORY AND LABOR POLITICIANS, BUT APPARENTLY NOT THE PRIME MINISTER . DURING THE CUBA BLOWUP, WARD WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, SUGGESTING TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE THAT HIS FRIEND IVANOV BE USED AS AN INTERMEDIARY TO HELP SETTLE THE CRISIS . BUT SAID MACMILLAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE THEN TRYING TO GET INTO THE ACT \" TO WEAKEN OUR RESOLUTION . \" A LITTLE LATER, WILSON HIMSELF GOT A LETTER FROM WARD, BOASTING OF HIS SUPPOSED HELP IN SETTLING THE CUBA MATTER, BUT FILED IT AWAY AS COMING FROM A CRANK . BEFORE IVANOV WAS RECALLED TO MOSCOW IN JANUARY 1963, HE AROUSED SUSPICION IN OTHER WAYS . A BRIDGE PLAYER WHO TOOK A HAND IN SOME VERY HIGH-LEVEL GAMES, HE LOST STEADILY, AS MUCH AS $140 A NIGHT . \" I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S PETTY CASH WOULD STAND SUCH LOSSES EVERY NIGHT, \" SAID ONE LABOR M.P . CAUSTICALLY, / UNLESS THEY GOT SOMETHING FOR IT . \" THE VIGIL . IN THE THIRD AND MOST REMARKABLE PHASE, MACMILLAN FINALLY BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A PROFUMO CASE . IN JANUARY 1963, AS MACMILLAN TOLD COMMONS POLICE LEARNED FROM CHRISTINE THAT WARD HAD ASKED HER TO FIND OUT FROM PROFUMO WHEN THE U.S . WAS TO DELIVER CERTAIN NUCLEAR INFORMATION AND WARHEADS TO WEST GERMANY (SHE SAID THAT SHE REFUSED TO DO IT) . MACMILLAN WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS EITHER . BUT WHILE HE WAS AWAY IN ITALY, THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HUGE (CIRC . 6,500,000) NEWS OF THE WORLD REPORTED THE PROFUMO RUMORS TO MACMILLAN'S PRINCIPAL PRIVATE SECRETARY . CONFRONTED WITH THE STORY, PROFUMO DENIED EVERYTHING TO SEVERAL OFFICIALS ; THE RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN INNOCENT, HE SAID, AND ANYWAY HAD ENDED LONG BEFORE . WHY DIDN'T THE PRIME MINISTER QUESTION PROFUMO HIMSELF AT ANY TIME ? MACMILLAN'S LAME ANSWER : HE ASSUMED THAT PROFUMO WOULD SPEAK MORE FREELY TO OTHERS, AND FURTHERMORE SUCH AN INTERROGATION WOULD HAVE MADE \" SOCIAL RELATIONS \" BETWEEN HIMSELF AND PROFUMO HIGHLY EMBARRASSING . AND WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ATTEMPT TO INTERROGATE CHRISTINE HERSELF TO CHECK OUT PROFUMO'S DENIAL ? TO THIS, MACMILLAN HAD NO ANSWER AT ALL . AFTER CHRISTINE FAILED TO APPEAR AS A WITNESS LAST MARCH IN THE TRIAL OF A JEALOUS NEGRO LOVER WHO HAD TRIED TO SHOOT HER, QUESTIONS WERE FINALLY RAISED IN PARLIAMENT . MACMILLAN ASKED FOR ACTION, ADMITTEDLY HOPING FOR A STATEMENT FROM PROFUMO THAT WOULD QUELL FURTHER RUMORS IN THE PRESS THROUGH FEAR OF LIBEL . WHEN THE HOUSE ADJOURNED AFTER MIDNIGHT, PROFUMO WAS AWAKENED, AND AT 1 : 30 A.M . CAME TO CHIEF TORY WHIP MARTIN REDMAYNE'S COMMONS OFFICE WITH HIS SOLICITOR . HE WAS CONFRONTED BY REDMAYNE, TORY CHAIRMAN IAIN MACLEOD, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO WILLIAM DEEDES, ATTORNEY GENERAL SIR JOHN HOBSON AND SOLICITOR GENERAL SIR PETER RAWLINSON . TWO OF PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS HAD BEEN AT HARROW WITH HIM . WHERE LAST WEEK HE WAS EXPELLED FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DISMISSED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, AND SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL . THE LETTER . UNDER FRIENDLY QUESTIONING UNTIL 5 A.M., PROFUMO DENIED MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE . HE AGREED TO MAKE A SACROSANCT \" PERSONAL STATEMENT, \" ASSURING THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED \" NO IMPROPRIETY WHATSOEVER \" WITH MISS KEELER . HIS FELLOW MINISTERS SUGGESTED THAT HE ADMIT AT LEAST TO BEING \" ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH HER, \" ALTHOUGH IT \" SOUNDED SO AWFUL, \" AS PROFUMO PUT IT . \" WE INSISTED THAT IT MUST BE INCLUDED, \" EXPLAINED MACLEOD FATUOUSLY LAST WEEK, \" BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE TRUTH . \" AGAINST HIMSELF AND THE FOUR OTHER MINISTERS, MACLEOD ADDED, \" TWO POSSIBLE CHARGES CAN BE BROUGHT . FIRST, THAT WE WERE CONSPIRING KNAVES, AND SECONDLY, THAT WE WERE GULLIBLE FOOLS . \" THEY WERE INDEED GULLIBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WANTED TO BE . EVEN THE MOST CURSORY CHECKING WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THAT WHILE CHRISTINE MAY HAVE HAD JOIE DE VIVRE, SHE HAD LITTLE DISCRETION . PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS KNEW BY THEN ABOUT A LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 BEGINNING \" DARLING . . . \" PROFUMO EXPLAINED, AS MACMILLAN PUT IT, THAT IN HIS CIRCLES \" IT WAS A TERM OF NO GREAT SIGNIFICANCE . I BELIEVE THAT THIS MIGHT BE ACCEPTED . I DO NOT LIVE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE FAIRLY WIDELY . \" BUT IF IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO MACMILLAN, AT 69 A LITTLE REMOTE FROM REALITY, IT SHOULD NOT HAVE FOOLED THE OTHERS . \" WE WERE A BUNCH OF NINNIES, \" ADMITS ONE OF THE FIVE PRIVATELY, AND ADDS WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOGIC : \" WE RECALLED THAT EARLIER CASE, IN WHICH \" MY DEAR VASSALL' PROVED TO BE HARMLESS, SO WE WERE BOUND TO FEEL THAT \" DARLING' MIGHT WELL BE SIMILARLY HARMLESS . \" THE EXIT . THE LAST PHASE OF THE CASE BEGAN AFTER PROFUMO PROCLAIMED HIS PURITY TO THE HOUSE, WAS WARMLY PATTED ON THE BACK BY THE PRIME MINISTER, AND WITH HIS WIFE, ACTRESS VALERIE HOBSON, WENT OFF TO THE RACES WITH THE QUEEN MOTHER, AND LATER ATTENDED A TORY BALL AT QUAGLINO'S, A WEST END NIGHTCLUB . BUT THERE WERE EDITORS AND M.P.'S WHO KNEW BY NOW THAT HE HAD LIED, AND PROFUMO SHOWED HIMSELF BOTH ARROGANT AND STUPID IN THINKING THAT HE COULD SUPPRESS THE TRUTH INDEFINITELY BY LIBEL SUITS . (IN FACT, HE SUED PARIS-MATCH FOR LIBEL AND COLLECTED OUT OF COURT FROM ITALY'S TEMPO ILLUSTRATO.) BESIDES, WARD BEGAN TO TALK, AND TO LABOR M.P . GEORGE WIGG HE UNFOLDED A TALE, AS WILSON DESCRIBED IT IN THE COMMONS, THAT \" TOOK THE LID OFF A CORNER OF THE LONDON UNDERWORLD VICE AND DOPE, MARIJUANA, BLACKMAIL AND COUNTER-BLACKMAIL, VIOLENCE, PETTY CRIME . \" ADDED WILSON GRATUITUOUSLY : \" IF WARD'S STATEMENT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AS A FICTION PAPERBACK IN AMERICA, IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED OVERDRAWN AND BEYOND BELIEF . \"  WILSON SENT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WARDWIGG CONVERSATION TO MACMILLAN, WHO TURNED IT OVER TO THE \" APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES, \" WHO FOUND NOTHING DISTURBING IN IT . PRODDED FURTHER, MACMILLAN WROTE WILSON : \" THERE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING IN THE PAPERS YOU SENT WHICH REQUIRES ME TO TAKE ANY ACTION . / WHEN JOHN VASSALL, A HOMOSEXUAL ADMIRALTY CLERK, WAS CONVICTED LAST OCTOBER OF SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS, MACMILLAN SUMMARILY FIRED THE CLERK'S SUPERIOR, THOMAS GALBRAITH, WHO HAD WRITTEN THE CLERK SOME LETTERS STARTING \" MY DEAR VASSALL . \" GALBRAITH WAS LATER WHOLLY EXONERATED . THOUGH POSSIBLY NOT IN BRITAIN, WHERE TROPIC OF CANCER HAS BEEN A BESTSELLER FOR MONTHS AND THE UNEXPURGATED LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER HAS SOLD 3,500,000 PAPERBACK COPIES . EVEN AFTER WARD SENT WILSON, THE HOME SECRETARY AND THE ENTIRE BRITISH PRESS A LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PROFUMO HAD LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE DISCLOSURE \" DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE ANY IMPRESSION \" ON THE PRIME MINISTER . WHILE ORDERING THE LORD CHANCELLOR TO INVESTIGATE WARD'S CHARGES, MACMILLAN ASSURED WILSON HE WAS CONFIDENT NONETHELESS THAT THE SECURITY QUESTION HAD BEEN \" FULLY AND EFFICIENTLY WATCHED \" ALTHOUGH, AS WILSON ACCURATELY POINTED OUT, MI-5 MEN APPARENTLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTINE UNTIL THEY READ ABOUT HER IN THE PAPERS . AS THE DISMAL FACTS AND ALIBIS TUMBLED OUT IN THE COMMONS, THE ADULATION AND AFFECTION THE TORIES HAD ONCE BESTOWED ON \" MACWONDER \" TURNED ALMOST VISIBLY TO A KIND OF STUPEFIED PITY . AT THE END OF HIS DEFENSE, MACMILLAN PLEADED : \" I AM ENTITLED TO THE SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE AND OF THE COUNTRY . \" BUT FROM THE TORY BENCHES, AS HE SAT DOWN, CAME A SOUND THAT WAS MORE SIGH THAN CHEER . BY TWOS AND THREES, PERTURBED BACKBENCHERS WENT OUT TO ARGUE IN THE LOBBIES WHILE SEVERAL TORY SPEAKERS CAUSTICALLY CONDEMNED THE PRIME MINISTER . MACMILLAN ROSE AND WITH BOWED HEAD LEFT THE CHAMBER . WHO NEXT ? SOME ANGRY TORIES FELT THAT MACMILLAN SHOULD RESIGN AT ONCE, BUT AT A BACKBENCHERS' MEETING THE VIEW PREVAILED THAT, AS ONE CABINET MINISTER PUT IT, \" THE COUNTRY MUST NOT GET THE FEELING THAT HE IS BEING HOUNDED OUT BECAUSE OF CHRISTINE KEELER . OUR PARTY WOULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT . \" THE PRESENT CONSENSUS IS THAT MACMILLAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETIRE RATHER THAN TO RESIGN, SOME TIME THIS SUMMER OR FALL . IN PERSPECTIVE, HE MAY WELL REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTERS IN TORY HISTORY, BUT FEW CONSERVATIVES WANT HIM IN COMMAND OF THEIR NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN ; EVEN PREPROFUMO, THE PARTY HAD BEEN IN BAD TROUBLE OVER DEFENSE MUDDLES, BRITAIN'S FAILURE TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET, AND ABOVE ALL MACMILLAN'S STOP-AND-GO FISCAL POLICIES AND A SLUGGISH ECONOMY . ALTHOUGH MACMILLAN HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATED RIVALS BY GIVING THEM THANKLESS TASKS OR SACKING THEM, THE TORIES HAVE A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE SUCCESSORS . CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD (DAILY EXPRESS ODDS : 4-7) IS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING, WHO IS YOUTHFUL (46) AND READY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A PREDICTED ECONOMIC SPURT THIS SUMMER . HE IS ALSO HAPPILY MARRIED, A PARTICULARLY USEFUL QUALIFICATION RIGHT NOW . NEXT ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER \" RAB \" BUTLER (2-1), WHO HAS ALL THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE, BUT AT 60 MAY HAVE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG ; AND LORD HAILSHAM, BELLICOSE, BLIMPISH SCIENCE MINISTER, 55, WHOSE HOPES FADED RAPIDLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT ITS LORDS REFORM BILL, WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO SIT IN THE COMMONS, WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED THIS SUMMER . TED HEATH, 46, IS GENERALLY RULED OUT BECAUSE HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMON MARKET FAILURE, AND BESIDES, HE IS A BACHELOR . WHAT NEXT ? ANY ONE OF THESE TORIES COULD GIVE LABOR A GOOD FIGHT IN THE NEXT ELECTION, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE TO BE HELD TILL THE FALL OF 1964 . BUT LABORITES FEEL THEMSELVES CLOSER TO POWER THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY TIME IN THE LAST DOZEN YEARS . AT WEEK'S END HAROLD WILSON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK IN THE COMMONS, DEMANDING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PROFUMO CASE BY A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE WITH SWEEPOING POWERS . THE MORE LIMITED JUDICIAL INQUIRY PROPOSED BY MACMILLAN, CRIED WILSON, WAS MERELY \" A COVER-UP, \" BECAUSE, WITHOUT AUTHORITY TO COMPEL PROOF OF THE ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES, IT WOULD HAVE TO COLLECT EVIDENCE \" FROM SOME OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED LIARS IN THIS COUNTRY WERE THERE ANY MORE REVELATIONS TO COME WILSON WANTED TO KNOW . NOTHING HE KNEW OF RIGHT NOW, SAID MACMILLAN, BUT HE ADDED : \" I HAVE HEARD TERRIBLE THINGS SAID OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF ALL, CHRISTINE HERSELF, VOLUNTEERED : \" APART FROM THOSE I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IN MY STORY, I DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE NOT MET ANY MINISTERS . \" MACMILLAN RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE . \" THEY HAVE DEEPLY WOUNDED ME, \" HE TOLD A TORY RALLY, ADDING : \" IT WILL NOT BREAK MY SPIRIT . \" BUT THE HOUSE STILL REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF TORY REBEL NIGEL BIRCH, WHO DURING THE BIG DEBATE HAD QUOTED BROWNING'S THE LOST LEADER AT HAROLD MACMILLAN : LET HIM NEVER COME BACK TO US ! THERE WOULD BE DOUBT, HESITATION AND PAIN . FORCED PRAISE ON OUR PART THE GLIMMER OF TWILIGHT, NEVER GLAD CONFIDENT MORNING AGAIN !\n",

LAST WEEK, URGED ON BY POSTERS THAT WARNED \" WHOEVER STAYS AT HOME VOTES FOR THE WALL, \" 90 PER CENT OF ELIGIBLE WEST BERLINERS TRUDGED THROUGH FOGGY, SNOWY STREETS TO GIVE ABLE MAYOR WILLY BRANDT, REUTER'S PROTEGE, A LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR ANOTHER TERM IN OFFICE . BRANDT'S SOCIALISTS GOT ALMOST 62 PER CENT OF THE 1,571,820 VOTES CAST ; IN THE WORKERS' STRONGHOLD OF WEDDING, THE DISTRICT WHICH BRANDT CHOSE AS HIS PERSONAL CONSTITUENCY, HE WON MORE THAN 75 PER CENT OF THE BALLOTS . CITYWIDE, THE PUNY COMMUNIST PARTY LOST ONE-THIRD OF ITS SUPPORT, ATTRACTING JUST A SHADE MORE THAN 1 PER CENT OF THE VOTE . BRANDT'S VICTORY WAS NO SURPRISE, FOR WEST BERLIN TRADITIONALLY VOTES SOCIALIST . WHAT WAS STARTLING WAS THE SIZE OF THE SOCIALIST GAIN, AND THE SHARP LOSS SUFFERED BY THE WEST BERLIN FACTION OF CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION . C.D.U . DEPUTY MAYOR FRANZ AMREHN LOST TO A LITTLE-KNOWN SOCIALIST, AND OVERALL C.D.U . STRENGTH IN THE BERLIN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DROPPED 25 PER CENT . THERE WERE, OF COURSE, LOCAL ISSUES, BUT NO ONE DOUBTED THAT THE C.D.U . SUFFERED FROM THE TARNISHED IMAGE OF ADENAUER'S NATIONAL PARTY, WHICH HAS BEEN SLIPPING IN LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS . RECENT DISCONTENT FOCUSES ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CLUMSY \" TREASON \" CRACKDOWN ON THE NEWSMAGAZINE DER SPIEGEL LAST NOVEMBER, AND MORE IMPORTANT, ON THE STUBBORN REFUSAL OF ADENAUER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR HIS OWN RETIREMENT AND CHOICE OF A NEW C.D.U . LEADER . WITH NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS DUE IN 1965, IT IS NONE TOO EARLY FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS TO START BUILDING UP A NEW CANDIDATE, WHETHER HE TURNS OUT TO BE VICE CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD, THE FASTRISING FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER, OR ONE OF THE PARTY'S DARK HORSES .

A LIE IN THE NUDE . THE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE DEBATE IN THE COMMONS CONSISTED MOSTLY OF TALK BUT WHAT TALK . CHRISTINE KEELER, THE CAUSE OF IT ALL, WAS STRANGELY IRREPRESSIBLE AND OUTWARDLY SERENE AMID THE TUMBLING OF FACADES AND THE CRASH OF REPUTATIONS . BLOSSOMING FORTH IN EVER MORE DAZZLING PHOTOGRAPHS SHE BECAME BRITAIN'S FASTEST-RISING FALLEN WOMAN . SHE WAS BESIEGED BY FILM AND NIGHTCLUB OFFERS AND INCORPORATED HERSELF AS CHRISTINE KEELER, LTD . SHE EVEN LANDED, UNCAPTIONED, ON THE COVER OF THE AUSTERE ECONOMIST . AS FOR HER MENTOR, OSTEOPATH STEPHEN WARD, HE WAS IN JAIL, BOUND FOR TRIAL ON CHARGES OF LIVING ON PROSTITUTES' EARNINGS . THE EVIDENCE, IT WAS WIDELY SUSPECTED, WOULD PROVE DAMAGING TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE . ALTHOUGH THE LABOR PARTY CONCENTRATED ON THE SECURITY QUESTION, IN PUBLIC DEBATE THE PROFUMO CASE INEVITABLY TURNED INTO A MORAL ISSUE . SIGNIFICANTLY, THE UNPARDONABLE CRIME OF EX-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR JOHN PROFUMO WAS NOT THAT HE WAS INDISCREET AND A POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK, BUT THAT HE LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN INITIALLY DENYING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRISTINE . MOREOVER, HE LIED STUPIDLY, SINCE HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIS DIGNITY AND HIS SEAT AS AN M.P . BY ADMITTING HIS MISSTEP . AS A LIMERICK THAT MADE THE ROUNDS OF WESTMINSTER LAST WEEK HAD IT : \" WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOU DONE .? \" SAID CHRISTINE, \" YOU HAVE WRECKED THE WHOLE PARTY MACHINE . \" TO LIE IN THE NUDE \" IS NOT AT ALL RUDE, \" BUT TO LIE IN THE HOUSE IS OBSCENE . / SERIALIZED SEX .

HE HAD GOOD REASON FOR CONFIDENCE : THE DAILY MAIL'S NATIONAL OPINION POLL GAVE LABOR ITS BIGGEST LEAD EVER : 69.2 PER CENT TO 19.8 PER CENT OVER THE TORIES . ON HIS RETURN FROM A GOLFING VACATION, MACMILLAN'S FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMMAND A UNITED CABINET . CALLING HIS MINISTERS INTO EMERGENCY SESSION, HE ASKED EACH MAN TO OUTLINE PRIVATELY HIS OWN VIEW OF THE SITUATION . WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE 21 TOP TORIES EXPRESSED DEEP DISMAY AT THE PUBLIC'S LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT . MACMILLAN WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO ALMOST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT POSSIBILITIES . HAD HE KNOWN ABOUT PROFUMO'S DOINGS, AND IN THAT CASE HAD HE NOT CONNIVED TO SOME EXTENT IN HIS FALSE DENIALS ? OR, DESPITE THE WAR MINISTER'S LONG REPUTATION AS A WOMANIZER, HAD MACMILLAN REALLY NOT KNOWN ANYTHING ? IN THAT CASE, HAD HE NOT BEEN NAIVE AND NEGLIGENT WHEN HE ACCEPTED PROFUMO'S DEFENSE ? BED & BAWD . IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, MACMILLAN MAINTAINS THAT HE WAS FIRST INFORMED OF PROFUMO'S LIAISON LAST FEBRUARY . HE DENIES REPORTS THAT MI-5 BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD WARNED THE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME THAT ITS WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED BED AND BAWD WITH SOVIET ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV . MACMILLAN INSISTED THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT A MAN OF PROFUMO'S BACKGROUND (HARROW, OXFORD, INFANTRY) . MOREOVER, FIVE OF HIS MINISTERS WHO \" SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT \" OF MARCH 21 INTERROGATING PROFUMO WERE ALSO PERSUADED THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ; THE CLINCHER WAS THE WAR MINISTER'S READINESS TO DENY MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE KEELER IN A SACROSANCT \" PERSONAL STATEMENT \" ON THE HOUSE FLOOR NEXT DAY . MACMILLAN'S STRONGEST ARGUMENT WAS THAT A SECURITY CHECK, WHICH HE ORDERED A WEEK BEFORE HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE'S CONFESSION, HAD TURNED UP NO EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN USING THE PROFUMO-KEELER-IVANOV TRIANGLE TO PRY OUT SECRET INFORMATION . SOMETHING OF A CABINET MUTINY SEEMED TO BE LED BY HEALTH MINISTER ENOCH POWELL, 51, WHOSE DISTASTE FOR POLITICAL COMPROMISE LED HIM TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958 IN PROTEST AGAINST AN INFLATIONARY, VOTE-CATCHING BUDGET . POWELL'S FEELING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ONCE MORE SHOWN ITSELF UNBELIEVABLY LAX WAS SHARED TO A LESSER DEGREE BY TWO MORE OF MACMILLAN'S ABLEST APPOINTEES, EDUCATION MINISTER SIR EDWARD BOYLE (WHO QUIT THE GOVERNMENT OVER SUEZ) AND HOUSING MINISTER SIR KEITH JOSEPH, AS WELL AS A DISGRUNTLED MINORITY OF TORY BACKBENCHERS, WHO COULD THEMSELVES OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT IF 20 OR 30 CHOSE TO ABSTAIN THIS WEEK . BUT MACMILLAN'S ASSURANCES QUELLED THE MUTINY, AND THE TORIES MARCHED INTO COMMONS OUTWARDLY UNITED TO FACE THEIR GREATEST POLITICAL THREAT SINCE SUEZ . AN ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT THE DATE ON WHICH THE U.S . WAS SUPPOSED TO \" GIVE THE H-BOMB TO WEST GERMANY, \" SOUNDED MORE LIKE A PROPAGANDA PLOY THAN SERIOUS ESPIONAGE . FLASH OF INDIGNATION . THE OPPOSITION MAY YET SUCCEED IN SHOWING THAT BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM WAS IN FACT BREACHED, OR THAT WARNINGS FROM INTELLIGENCE FELL ON DEAF EARS . WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THIS WEEK'S COMMONS DEBATE, THERE IS A GROWING BELIEF THAT MACMILLAN WILL HAVE TO STEP DOWN EVENTUALLY AND MAY IN FACT HAVE PROMISED HIS OWN DISSIDENT MINISTERS TO DO SO ONCE THE HEAT IS OFF . LOOSE FACTIONS WERE ALREADY FORMING AROUND SUCH POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TO MACMILLAN AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R . A . ( \" RAB \" ) BUTLER, CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING AND SCIENCE MINISTER LORD HAILSHAM . NO MATTER HOW ELOQUENTLY MACMILLAN MAY WEATHER THE PARLIAMENTARY CRISIS, THE TORIES SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE TARRED BY CHRISTINE . WHAT THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY OFFERED THE NATION IS MEN BORN AND RAISED IN THE EXACTING DISCIPLINES OF LEADERSHIP . IF NOW, IN ADDITION TO ALL THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REVERSES THEY HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST YEAR, BRITONS SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT ETONIAN AND HARROVIAN LEADERS ARE PERSONALLY NO WISER OR MORE UPRIGHT AND IN MANY CASES THEY HAVE PROVED FLAGRANTLY LESS SO THAN THOSE WHOM THEY GOVERN, TWELVE YEARS OF TORY GOVERNMENT MAY END IN A MIGHTY FLASH OF MORAL INDIGNATION MIXED WITH RIDICULE .\n",

      "     Preview: CHARLES DE GAULLE'S VISION OF A FRENCH-LED EUROPE, MANY FRENCHMEN LAST WEEK WERE UNEASILY CONTEMPLATING DE GAULLE'S INFLUENCE ON THEIR OWN SOCIETY . SINCE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION TURNED THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INTO A VIRTUAL ANNEXE OF THE ELYSEE PALACE, DE GAULLE HAS RULED WITH LITTLE PARLIAMENTARY CRITICISM AND WITH ONLY MUTED RUMBLINGS FROM FRANCE'S ONCE RAMBUNCTIOUS PRESS . IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT LE GRAND CHARLES HAS ESTABLISHED A PERSONAL REGIME IN WHICH, THOUGH IT IS NOT REMOTELY SO AUTOCRATIC A GOVERNMENT AS THAT OF FRANCISCO FRANCO, ALMOST ANY POTENTIAL CONTROVERSY IS SIMILARLY QUELLED BY THE GOVERNMENT LEST IT BE INTERPRETED ABROAD AS A DIRECT EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL POLICIES . WITH VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED POWERS UNDER FRANCE'S EMERGENCY LAWS, DE GAULLE'S GOVERNMENT IN RECENT MONTHS HAS : CANCELED THE SHOWING OF A TV DOCUMENTARY TO MARK THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF STALINGRAD . PREPARED BY THE STATE-OWNED TV NETWORK, THE FILM INCLUDED A TIRADE BY NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV THAT, IN THE GOVERNMENT'S WORDS, WAS \" VIOLENTLY HOSTILE TO WEST GERMANY AND TO THE POLICY OF FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . \" SAME WEEK, ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY MOVIE, DEATH IN MADRID, CONSISTING MOSTLY OF STOCK SHOTS TAKEN DURING THE 1936 SPANISH CIVIL WAR, WAS DENIED A LICENSE FOR EXHIBITION IN FRANCE OR ABROAD PRESUMABLY FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING FRANCO . ORDERED THE PARIS OPERA TO CANCEL A PERFORMANCE BY RUDOLF NUREYEV, A RUSSIAN BALLET DANCER WHO DEFECTED TO THE WEST IN 1961 . THOUGH NUREYEV HAS ALREADY DANCED IN PARIS, LONDON AND NEW YORK, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT PLAINLY FELT THAT HIS APPEARANCE IN PARIS WOULD BE AN AFFRONT TO NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV . CONFISCATED NEARLY 75,000 COPIES OF A NOVEL, HIGH COURT, IN WHICH RIGHT-WING AUTHOR ALFRED FABRE-LUCE GIVES A FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF A FUTURE TRIAL OF DE GAULLE AS IT MIGHT BE CONDUCTED IF HE WERE IMPEACHED BY THE SENATE . THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECT THIS TIME WAS TO AVOID OFFENSE TO CHARLES DE GAULLE HIMSELF . SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REPRESSIONS ARE EXPLICABLE AS INTERNATIONAL BACKSCRATCHING . DE GAULLE'S INCREASING AMIABILITY TOWARD SPAIN HAS BEEN REWARDED BY FRANCO'S JAILING OF SIX TOP ANTI-GAULLIST TERRORISTS WHO WERE HIDING OUT IN SPAIN . BANNING THE STALINGRAD SHOW MAY JUST POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN REPAID LAST WEEK WHEN GERMAN POLICE FAILED TO PREVENT MYSTERIOUS FRENCH AGENTS IN MUNICH FROM KIDNAPING A TOP S.A.O . LEADER, ANTOINE ARGOUD (SEE BELOW) . BUT IT SEEMED UNLIKELY THAT KHRUSHCHEV WOULD CARE GREATLY IF NUREYEV DANCED IN PARIS, OR THAT ADENAUER WOULD OBJECT TO BEING DAMNED BY NIKITA ON TV . ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN A GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO CENSURE OR LEGAL REDRESS, WHO EXPECTS LOGIC ?\n",

FRENCH SURETE AGENTS FLEW IN AHEAD OF TIME TO GO OVER THE DOSSIERS OF RESIDENT FOREIGNERS AND EYE NEW ARRIVALS AT HELLENIKON AIRPORT . GREEK ARMY ENGINEERS PROWLED THE SEWERS OF ATHENS, SEARCHING FOR HIDDEN BOMBS ; GREY-UNIFORMED COPS STOOD GUARD 25 YARDS APART ALONG THE EIGHT-MILE PARADE ROUTE . EMOTIONALLY, A RETIRED GREEK GENERAL ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY READY TO SLASH HIS WRISTS TO GIVE BLOOD, IF DE GAULLE WERE SHOT . MORE PRUDENTLY, GREECE'S PREMIER CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS HAD HIS OWN BLOOD TYPED, IN CASE HE GOT IN THE WAY OF ANY SHOOTING . DRIFTING SMOKE . IN THE EVENT, THE PRECAUTIONS SEEMED EXCESSIVE . DE GAULLE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AT NOON IN HIS BLUE-ANDWHITE CARAVELLE JET AIRLINER, INSPECTED AN HONOR GUARD AS CANNON SMOKE FROM THE 21-GUN SALUTE DRIFTED INTO HIS FACE, THEN CLIMBED INTO A ROLLS-ROYCE CONVERTIBLE WITH GREECE'S TALL KING PAUL . AS THE MOTORCADE REACHED THE CITY LIMITS, DE GAULLE JUMPED TO HIS FEET, WAVED THEATRICALLY TO THE ATHENIANS GATHERED UNDER THE PEPPER TREES . AT HADRIAN'S ARCH, NEAR THE TEMPLE OF OLYMPIAN ZEUS, HE SAID WITH FEELING : \" NO FRENCHMAN, ESPECIALLY MYSELF, COULD FAIL TO BE MOVED BY THIS CITY, NOR FORGET WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED HERE FOR LIBERTY IN 3,000 YEARS . \" THEN HE PLUNGED NEARSIGHTEDLY INTO THE CURBSIDE CROWD TO SHAKE HANDS A PROCEDURE THAT GIVES HIS SECURITY GUARDS PERPETUAL JITTERS . BUT THE CHANCE OF A POTSHOT AT DE GAULLE WAS NOT THE ONLY WORRY OF GREEK LEADERS . THE GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO UNEASY THAT DE GAULLE MIGHT TRY TO EMBROIL GREECE IN HIS QUARREL WITH BRITAIN OVER THE COMMON MARKET, AND WITH THE U.S . OVER NATO DEFENSE . IT WAS FRANCE, NOT GREECE, WHICH HAD PUSHED THE TRIP . DE GAULLE HAD PICKED UP AN INVITATION MADE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE TO THEN PRESIDENT RENE COTY . PARIS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE FRENCH FLEET DROP ANCHOR IN THE PIRAEUS TO COINCIDE WITH DE GAULLE'S ARRIVAL, AND DISCREETLY BROACHED THE PLAN OF HAVING DE GAULLE ADDRESS THE GREEK PUBLIC, AS HE HAD DONE WITH SUCH SUCCESS DURING HIS GERMAN TOUR LAST YEAR . WHEN GREEK REACTION TO BOTH IDEAS WAS COOL, THEY WERE ABANDONED . THE HINGE . NEVERTHELESS, GREECE WAS IN A MOOD TO BE WOOED BY LE GRAND CHARLES . ATHENS OFFICIALS WERE SHOCKED LAST SUMMER, WHEN THE $20 MILLION ANNUAL U.S . DEFENSE AND ECONOMIC AID WAS ABRUPTLY CUT OFF ON THE THEORY THAT THE GREEK ECONOMY NO LONGER NEEDED IT . DE GAULLE IS SAID TO BE PREPARED TO CLIMAX HIS VISIT WITH AN OFFER OF A $10 MILLION DEVELOPMENT LOAN ; FRENCH INVESTMENTS IN GREECE ALREADY TOTAL $60X MILLION AND ARE SECOND ONLY TO U.S . INVESTMENT . AT A PALACE BANQUET, DE GAULLE MADE CLEAR IN A TOAST TO KING PAUL THAT HE HOPES TO EXTEND FRANCE'S INFLUENCE FROM THE \" NORTHERN SEAS, \" WHICH HE CALLED ONE OF FRANCE'S BOUNDARIES, TO THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN, WHERE, HE POINTED OUT, GREECE IS THE \" HINGE BETWEEN THE LATIN AND SLAVIC WORLDS, AS WELL AS BETWEEN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST . \" THESE WORDS, AND DE GAULLE'S WOOING MANNER, SET DIPLOMATS EVERYWHERE TO A FRESH STUDY OF HIS UPCOMING AMBITIOUS TRAVEL PLANS : IN OCTOBER, CHARLES DE GAULLE, 72, IS SCHEDULED TO VISIT IRAN AND HE IS CONSIDERING LATER TRIPS TO JAPAN, SOUTH AMERICA, NORTH AFRICA, AND THE NEWLY INDEPENDENT NATIONS OF BLACK AFRICA . \" TODAY, FRANCE, \" MURMURED ONE DAZZLED OBSERVER . \" TOMORROW THE WORLD . /\n",

TWICE MARRIED BUT NOW A WIDOWER, ESHKOL HAS FOUR DAUGHTERS, ONE OF WHOM TEACHES DANCING IN JERUSALEM, WHILE ANOTHER IS A SERGEANT IN THE ISRAELI ARMY . HIS NEW CABINET STRONGLY RESEMBLES BEN-GURION'S OLD ONE, AND IT IS UNLIKELY THERE WILL BE ANY RADICAL CHANGES IN FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC POLICY .

HE HOPES ALSO TO FURTHER HIS PET PROJECT : THE \" CULTURAL ABSORPTION \" OF JEWISH IMMIGRANTS FROM ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA INTO ISRAEL'S PREDOMINANTLY WESTERN SOCIETY .

A ROUND-EYED OBSERVER OF THEIR COEXISTENCE WAS NYMPHET MARILYN ( \" MANDY \" ) RICE-DAVIES, A WELL-DEVELOPED 16-YEAR-OLD, WHO WAS ONE OF CHRISTINE'S INTIMATES . \" THE FARCICAL THING ABOUT IT ALL, \" AS MANDY TOLD THE PRESS, \" WAS THAT, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, AS JACK LEFT CHRISTINE AT THE FLAT, IVANOV WALKED IN . \" IT POSSIBLY SEEMED LESS HILARIOUS TO BRITISH MI-5 INTELLIGENCE AGENTS, WHO WERE SHADOWING IVANOV AT THE TIME, TO FIND THAT THEIR WAR MINISTER WAS UNWITTINGLY SHARING A BED WITH A SUSPECTED SOVIET SPY . THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE THOUGH THEY TRIED NOT TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC, PROFUMO SOMETIMES TOOK CHRISTINE FOR DRIVES, SHE LATER RECALLED . \" HE SHOWED ME THE WAR OFFICE, WHERE HE WORKED . HE EVEN SHOWED ME DOWNING STREET . \" BUT IN TIME PROFUMO STOPPED SEEING CHRISTINE BECAUSE, SHE EXPLAINED, HE WAS \" SCARED IT WOULD RUIN HIS CAREER . \" COMRADE IVANOV WAS SHIPPED OFF TO MOSCOW, AND THE \" MODEL \" FROM MIDDLESEX, WHO HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR JAZZ ON THE WAY UP, HIT THE BLUES BELT AND ACQUIRED A JAMAICAN LOVER NAMED JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE . BUT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HER TELEPHONE WAS FOR . \" HE SEEMED TO THINK, \" CHRISTINE COMPLAINED LATER, \" THAT I WAS GOING TO LIVE WITH HIM FOREVER . \" ONE DAY, JOHNNIE SHOWED UP WITH A GUN AND FIRED SEVERAL BULLETS INTO THE DOOR BEFORE THE BOBBIES BAGGED HIM . MULTIRACIALISM . AFTER JOHNNIE WENT TO JAIL, THERE WAS ANOTHER WEST INDIAN LOVER, ALOYSIUS \" LUCKY \" GORDON, WHO, IF ANYTHING, WAS EVEN MORE NARROWMINDED . IN APRIL HE BEAT HER UP . LAST WEEK, AT HIS TRIAL FOR ASSAULT, ALOYSIUS WAS SO UNGALLANT AS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAD KEPT HER SUPPLIED WITH MARIJUANA, WHILE ALL SHE GAVE HIM IN RETURN WAS VD . \" YOU CAN SAY THIS FOR CHRISTINE, \" SAID A LEADING LABOR POLITICIAN . \" AT LEAST SHE'S MULTIRACIAL . \" THE SCANDAL MIGHT HAVE DIED, HAD IT NOT BEEN RESURRECTED BY STEPHEN WARD HIMSELF . SEVEN WEEKS AFTER PROFUMO'S DENIAL, HE TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE SECRETARY THAT THE WAR MINISTER HAD LIED IN COMMONS, THAT HE HAD INDEED HAD AN AFFAIR WITH CHRISTINE KEELER . WARD REPEATED HIS CHARGES IN LETTERS TO HOME SECRETARY HENRY BROOKE AND LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON . PROFUMO WAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS NEW ACCUSATION, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT HE STARTLED TORY OFFICIALS BY BLURTING THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTINE IN A LETTER TO THE VACATIONING PRIME MINISTER, PROFUMO RESIGNED AS WAR MINISTER AND AS M.P . FOR STRATFORD-ON-AVON, CONFESSING HIS \" GRAVE MISDEMEANOR . \" SAID HE : \" I CANNOT TELL YOU OF MY DEEP REMORSE . \" MACMILLAN ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION, DESCRIBING THE AFFAIR AS \" A GREAT TRAGEDY . \" THEN PROFUMO AND HIS WIFE LEFT THEIR REGENT'S PARK HOME AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE COUNTRY . DILEMMA . THE SCANDAL HE LEFT BEHIND GOT LIVELIER EVERY DAY . CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO WAS BACK FROM A CONTINENTAL HOLIDAY AND SUDDENLY SPORTED A \" BUSINESS MANAGER \" AND A NEW ROLLS-ROYCE, ADDED MORE OFF-COLOR TO THE SAGA BY TELLING AND SELLING HER STORY TO THE PAPERS . \" I WAS VERY FOND OF JACK, \" SHE SAID WISTFULLY . \" IF EVER WE MEET AGAIN, WE HAVE AT LEAST THIS IN COMMON BOTH OUR CAREERS HAVE BEEN RUINED . \" MANDY CHIMED IN WITH DETAILS OF THE HIGH LIVING THAT HAD EARNED HER A JAGUAR, MINK AND DIAMONDS BY HER 17TH BIRTHDAY . AT ONE DINNER PARTY, SHE RECALLED, \" A NAKED MAN WEARING A MASK WAITED ON TABLE LIKE A SLAVE . HE HAD TO HAVE A MASK BECAUSE HE WAS SO WELL KNOWN . / MEANWHILE STEPHEN WARD'S EXPLANATIONS FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS AND TV SCREENS . THE AFFAIR, HE PROTESTED, HAD GIVEN RISE TO \" A WHOLE TRAIN OF RUMORS, AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WERE MENTIONED, WITH THE IMPLICATION THAT I'D BEEN TRYING TO PROCURE THEM FOR MISS KEELER . \" DESPITE HIS SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO PROTECT PROFUMO AND THE GOVERNMENT, SAID WARD, HE HAD REPORTED PROFUMO'S LIAISON TO BRITISH INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT IN 1961 . SAID HE : \" I'VE ALMOST HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN . IT'S A TERRIBLE DILEMMA . ONE DIDN'T WANT TO BITCH UP ANYBODY . YOU OWE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS . BUT I MUST CLEAR MYSELF . \" FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, STEPHEN WARD WILL DO HIS EXPLAINING IN COURT . AT WEEK'S END SCOTLAND YARD PLUCKED THE OSTEOPATH FROM HIS WHITE JAGUAR SPORTS CAR AND JAILED HIM ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING BRITAIN'S SEXUAL OFFENSES ACT BY / LIVING WHOLLY OR IN PART ON THE EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTION . \" UNREST . AS A MATTER OF POLITICAL TACTICS, THE LABOR PARTY DECIDED TO TREAT THE PROFUMO AFFAIR NOT SO MUCH AS A MORAL INDICTMENT OF UPPERCRUST BRITAIN BUT RATHER AS ANOTHER FLAGRANT EXAMPLE OF THE ERRATIC WORKINGS OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM . IF, ARGUED LABORITES, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT BRITAIN'S WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED A CALL GIRL WITH A SOVIET AGENT, WHY WAS NOTHING DONE TO BREAK UP A LIAISON THAT MIGHT EXPOSE HIM TO RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL ? WAS MACMILLAN TOLD ? IF SO, HAD THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED PROFUMO TO LIE ABOUT HIS DALLIANCE WITH CHRISTINE KEELER SOLELY IN ORDER TO AVERT A DAMAGING SCANDAL ? UNFLAPPABLE HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO DID NOT ALLOW LAST WEEK'S EVENTS TO INTERRUPT HIS GOLFING VACATION, WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE WHEN PARLIAMENT RECONVENES NEXT WEEK . HE MAY YET, AS IN THE PAST, CONFOUND HIS CRITICS IN COMMONS . BUT THE AFFAIR MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE TORIES' ALREADY SHAKY CHANCES AT THE NEXT ELECTIONS, WHICH MACMILLAN WILL NOW PROBABLY TRY TO DELAY . SAID TORY BACKBENCHER LORD LAMBTON : \" THE HARM THIS WILL DO TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL BE ENORMOUS . THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME A GENERAL FEELING OF UNREST IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO THE MORALITY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT . THIS FEELING WILL BE IMMENSELY INCREASED . /\n",

      "     Preview: CELEBRATE HIS SIXTH FULL YEAR IN OFFICE THE LONGEST TERM FOR A TORY SINCE 1902 PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN WENT BEFORE THE CAMERAS FOR A TELEVISION INTERVIEW LAST WEEK . IT WAS A MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE . RELAXED AND CONFIDENT, MACMILLAN TALKED WITH EASY CONFIDENCE OF THE PROMISE AND PROBLEMS OF BRITAIN TODAY . OFF-CAMERA, THINGS WERE NOT GOING SO WELL AS HAROLD MACMILLAN MADE IT SEEM . BRITAIN'S HOPES OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET HUNG PRECARIOUSLY IN THE BALANCE . AFTER THE DECISIONS AT NASSAU, A QUESTION MARK ROSE OVER THE FUTURE OF ITS MILITARY POWER . THE LATEST GALLUP POLL SHOWED LABOR LEADING THE TORIES 45 PER CENT TO 36 PER CENT . MANY OF MACMILLAN'S OWN CONSERVATIVE PARTY BACKBENCHERS WERE CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INABILITY TO STOP THE GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT IN BRITAIN'S NORTH . REASON FOR CONFIDENCE . SEEKING A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF JOBS, MACMILLAN LAST WEEK GAVE LORD HAILSHAM A NEW MINISTERIAL TASK OF STUDYING THE NORTHEAST DEPRESSED AREAS, AND TOLD BIRMINGHAM BUSINESSMEN THAT \" WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK \" THE ECONOMIC SLUMP MIGHT BE REVERSED THIS YEAR . AS ANOTHER WEAPON AGAINST POLITICAL DECLINE, MACMILLAN IS CLEARLY COUNTING ON ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING OBSTACLES AHEAD . ON TV HE SAID : \" I BELIEVE THAT AS SOON AS THE COMMON MARKET IS SETTLED, AND AS SOON AS IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT, YOU WILL FIND THE BUSINESSMEN REINVESTING ON A BIGGER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE . THAT IS WHY I AM CONFIDENT ABOUT 1963 . \" A DECISION ON COMMON MARKET ENTRY MAY BE IMMINENT . THIS WEEK BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR EDWARD HEATH RETURNS TO BRUSSELS FOR A CRUCIAL ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE'S SIX THE \" CRUNCH \" TALKS IN WHICH BRITAIN WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO . WHEN LORD SALISBURY RESIGNED AFTER A SEVEN YEAR TERM . DISMANTLE ITS OWN ELABORATE SYSTEM OR PERSUADE THE EUROPEANS TO EASE THEIR TERMS FOR ENTRY . SEEKING SUPPORT . IN PREPARATION FOR THE BRUSSELS MEETING, TED HEATH WENT TO CHEQUERS, MACMILLAN'S MINISTERIAL ESTATE, SPENT HOURS URGING HIS VIEWS ON WEST GERMANY'S VISITING FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER, A CONSIDERABLE SYMPATHIZER . THEN HEATH CROSSED TO THE CONTINENT TO LINE UP ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN'S POSITION . HE TALKED WITH BELGIUM'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HENRI FAYAT, WHO WANTS BRITAIN IN THE COMMON MARKET, AND WITH FRANCE'S FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHO FAITHFULLY ECHOED DE GAULLE'S RELUCTANCE TO LOWER THE BARS FOR BRITAIN . MACMILLAN HIMSELF WILL CONTINUE THE TASK ON HIS FEB . 1 VISIT TO ROME FOR MEETINGS WITH ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER AMINTORE FANFANI, DUE THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON . AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, THE TORIES WON RELIEF OF SORTS FROM THE DRUMFIRE OF CRITICISM AT HOME THROUGH A TRAGIC HAPPENSTANCE IN THE LABOR PARTY . HUGH GAITSKELL, LABOR'S CAPABLE, HARD-WORKING LEADER, WAS RUSHED TO LONDON'S MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA, DOUBLE PLEURISY AND SEVERE PERIOCARDITIS . IN GREAT PAIN AND SCARCELY ABLE TO BREATHE, GAITSKELL WAS ALLOWED NO VISITORS EXCEPT HIS WIFE . SNAP PRESSURE . LABOR SPOKESMEN OFFICIALLY SPREAD THE NEWS THAT GAITSKELL WOULD BE BACK AT WORK WITHIN FIVE TO SIX WEEKS, BUT MEDICAL MEN THOUGHT THREE TO SIX MONTHS MORE LIKELY . THIS MEANS HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEAD LABOR'S ATTACK ON BRITAIN'S COMMON MARKET ENTRY . IN FACT, TO LABOR'S ACUTE EMBARRASSMENT, THE MAN WHO BECOMES SPOKESMAN IN GAITSKELL'S PLACE IS DEPUTY LEADER GEORGE BROWN, WHO IS AS PRO-COMMON MARKET AS GAITSKELL AS ANTI . THE CONSERVATIVE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH PAID TRIBUTE TO GAITSKELL BY SUGGESTING THAT \" WITHOUT HIM, THERE CAN BE NO ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT WORTH THE NAME . \" SOME TORIES PROMPTLY URGED MACMILLAN TO CALL A SNAP GENERAL ELECTION WHILE LABOR IS VIRTUALLY LEADERLESS . BUT MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RESIST THE PRESSURE, SELECT HIS OWN TIME BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER 1964, THE DATE BY WHICH A GENERAL ELECTION MUST BE HELD . IF, DURING THE \" CRUNCH \" OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IN BRUSSELS, BRITAIN IS ADMITTED TO THE COMMON MARKET ON AN APPROXIMATION OF ITS OWN TERMS, AND IF THE STRAITENED ECONOMY REVIVES AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION FOR A GENERAL ELECTION IN THE FALL . MACMILLAN, WHO WILL BE 69 NEXT MONTH, SAID DURING HIS TV INTERVIEW THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD PUT IN ANOTHER SIX YEARS ON THE JOB, AND ADDED JOKINGLY : \" THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PEOPLE COULD STAND ANOTHER SIX . \" THE ANSWER MAY BE LEARNED DURING THE COMING FATEFUL WEEKS IN BRUSSELS .\n",

THE DELEGATES DISAVOWED ANY INTENTION OF STARTING A TRADE WAR WITH THE SIX, FOR AFTER ALL, THE COMMON MARKET WAS STILL THE BIGGEST CUSTOMER FOR EFTA EXPORTS . \" WE STILL REGARD THE SEVEN AS A SENSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO EUROPEAN UNITY, \" DECLARED EFTA SECRETARY GENERAL FRANK FIGGURES . WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF AUSTRIA, WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET, ALL OF BRITAIN'S OUTER SEVEN PARTNERS HAVE NOW SUSPENDED THEIR APPLICATIONS TO JOIN THE SIX, AGREE MEANWHILE THAT ANY MOVE TO LINK THE TWO COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE TO COME FROM BRUSSELS .

OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, ON HIS OWN PEOPLE AND ON THEIR NEIGHBORS, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS PERFECTED HIS NATIVE TALENT FOR HANDING OUT RUDE SURPRISES . EMPLOYING THE LOFTY DISDAIN THAT USED TO INFURIATE ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN, DE GAULLE SUCCEEDED IN INFURIATING KENNEDY, MACMILLAN AND A HOST OF OTHERS BY VETOING BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENTLE ABOUT IT, ALLOWING NEGOTIATIONS TO SPUTTER OUT IN A CONFUSION OF DETAILS . HE CHOSE TO BE BLUNT AND HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO SHUT OUT BRITAIN OR MERELY TO HUMILIATE HER . HE ALSO SHOOK THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE TO ITS ROOTS, SET OUT TO CONTEST ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO PUT IN QUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE U.S . IN EUROPE . FOR THE WEST ! HE CREATED A DRAMATIC HISTORICAL TURN, AN OBSCURE DESTINATION . DEAD MECHANISM . WESTERN EUROPE HEARD THE NEWS WITH ANGER AND DISMAY . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD BLAMED DE GAULLE FOR A \" BLACK DAY, \" DECLARING THAT \" THE COMMON MARKET IS NOW ONLY A MECHANISM AND NO LONGER A LIVING THING . \" ALFRED MULLERARMACK, WEST GERMANY'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR AT BRUSSELS, QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST . JEAN MONNET, THE DYNAMIC OPTIMIST WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE COMMON MARKET, LAMENTED THAT \" THERE NOW LOOMS DISUNION WITH ITS INHERENT DANGERS . \" BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN TOLD HIS COUNTRY ON TV : \" WHAT HAPPENED AT BRUSSELS WAS BAD . BAD FOR US, BAD FOR EUROPE, BAD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD . \" , \" BRUTAL \" WAS THE WORD HEARD MOST OFTEN IN WHITEHALL AND AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO DESCRIBE DE GAULLE'S BEHAVIOR . ARCHITECT OR AT LEAST CO-DESIGNERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, U.S . POLICYMAKERS WERE PLUNGED INTO GLOOM . \" MOST UNFORTUNATE, \" SAID THE STATE DEPARTMENT . IN CONGRESS THERE WERE REVIVED MUTTERINGS ABOUT THE INEFFICACY OF FOREIGN AID AND THE INGRATITUDE OF ALLIES . ARKANSAS' SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT TALKED OF THE \" TEMPORARY ABERRATION \" OF THE MAN . A NATION THAT HAD HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO PROFIT FROM THE COMMUNIST SPLIT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND RED CHINA FOUND A DEEP CREVICE OPENING AT ITS FEET . AND THOUGH THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SPEAK OF AN \" AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL \" OF ITS RELATIONS WITH A RECALCITRANT FRANCE AS JOHN FOSTER DULLES ONCE HAD U.S . MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC POLICY TOWARD EUROPE WAS PLAINLY IN NEED OF ONE . COMMUNITY TWILIGHT . EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN, AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED IN MOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATION OF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILL INEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR \" INNER CONTRADICTIONS . \" CRIED A RUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : \" THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OF STATE . \" NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONE TORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHED HIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20 YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT QUITE THIS WAY . PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE . THAT THEY DID IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 . HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES, SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT, TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE \" GRAND DESIGN, \" IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S . INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE, LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940 HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE \" STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . \" GARGANTUAN STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS . THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST, GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG . BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND 2) HAS \" SPECIAL TIES \" WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950, LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD . / MATTER OF DAYS . \" DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :. THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : \" IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR . THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE \" INSULAR, MARITIME \" BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO \" EUROPEANS \" BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S . WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE \" TROJAN HORSE \" FIRST BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING . NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF BRITAIN, GRUNTED, \" WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . \" A FRENCH DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, \" IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING . \" ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED, AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM . MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION, TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A \"MONSTROUS THING .\" DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED, HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  \"IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS,\" HE DECLARED .  \"IN REALITY, OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN . WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME, NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  \"IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED,\" HE SAID ,\"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT .\"  ADDED HEATH :\"THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS, THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF .\"  WHEN HE STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES, THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED 40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON MARKET (\"FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN,\" SAID A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME . IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT, TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, \"FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY . DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM WITHIN . SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES \"LONELY PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES .\" WHAT DISTURBS MANY AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS . DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE \"BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET .\" SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK, AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV, WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY . THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE TOLD AN AIDE, \" NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST PUSH IN EUROPE . \" THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE, AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, \" REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . \" ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST . HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN EUROPE, THE GRADUAL \" BOURGEOISATION \" OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES, WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, \" STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS . \" HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE . NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . \" AND, HE ARGUES, \" IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE . \" IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S . NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . \" I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE, BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . \" IN EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP . IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE \" COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE FREE WORLD . \" IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, \" THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . \" THE SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY . . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?\n",

RED SUMMIT . ACCORDING TO PROBABLY DELIBERATE CONFERENCE LEAKS, TITO TOLD KHRUSHCHEV THAT RUSSIA MUST PLAY UP TO THE EMERGING AFRO-ASIAN NATIONS TO HALT INCREASING CHINESE PENETRATION .

(BOTH RUSSIA AND YUGOSLAVIA FAVOR PEKING'S ADMISSION, BUT WITH WANING ENTHUSIASM), MOSCOW COULD MAKE HEADWAY BY SUPPORTING THE AFRO-ASIAN DRIVE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE U.N .

TITO ALSO SAID THAT RUSSIA IS BEING TOO DOCTRINAIRE IN WRITING OFF AFRO-ASIAN COUNTRIES SUCH AS SYRIA, ALGERIA, EGYPT AND IRAQ, WHICH HAVE OUTLAWED LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTIES . SINCE MOST OF THE EMERGING STATES ARE ADOPTING ONE-PARTY SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS ANYWAY, SAID TITO, THE SOVIETS SHOULD BACK THEM FOR THE TIME BEING, WORRY ABOUT PUSHING COMMUNISM LATER .

CHINESE CREWS ON THE PEKING-MOSCOW EXPRESS SCATTERED BUNDLES OF THE MANIFESTO THROUGH COACH WINDOWS, USED THE TRAIN'S PUBLIC-ADDRESS SYSTEM TO READ THE CHINESE CHARGES TO THE CAPTIVE SOVIET AUDIENCE . AFTER MOSCOW EXPELLED THREE CHINESE DIPLOMATS FOR HAVING A HAND IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY CIRCULATION CAMPAIGN, PEKING OSTENTATIOUSLY WELCOMED THEM HOME WITH BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS . AT THE SAME TIME, THE CHINESE CONDEMNED THE SOVIET MOVE AS A VIOLATION OF ITS RIGHT, AS A GOVERNMENT, TO CIRCULATE STATEMENTS ABROAD . NONSENSE, REPLIED THE SOVIETS . WHAT GAVE THE CHINESE THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD \" BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY WERE IN ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF CHINA ? \" SUCH TACTICS, FUMED THE KREMLIN, WERE PLAINLY A VIOLATION OF SOVIET SOVEREIGNTY : \" IT IS OBVIOUS THAT INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO A RAPPROCHEMENT, THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP AIMS AT AGGRAVATING DIFFERENCES . \" EQUALLY MATCHED . IF THAT WAS PEKING'S PURPOSE, IT COULD FIND NO BETTER MAN THAN TENG . SHORT, STOCKY, IN HIS 60S, TENG WAS BELIEVED BADLY CRIPPLED IN THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR, STILL HAS A LIMP AND A NERVOUS TIC WHEN HE SPEAKS WHICH DOES NOT KEEP HIM FROM SPEAKING OFTEN AND ABRASIVELY . NO STRANGER TO THE RUSSIANS, HE ATTENDED TWO PREVIOUS MOSCOW MEETINGS ON THE SPLIT IN 1957 AND IN 1960 . A VETERAN OF MAO'S LONG MARCH TO YENAN IN THE 1930S, TENG CAME TO PROMINENCE AS A POLITICAL COMMISSAR IN THE ARMY, SINCE 1952 HAS RISEN TO A PLACE AMONG THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE MEN IN RED CHINA'S HIERARCHY . IN PRESTIGE AND PERSONALITY HE IS A MATCH FOR SUSLOV, 60, WHO FOR YEARS WAS STALIN'S IDEOLOGICAL MOUTHPIECE, AND NOW SUPPLIES KHRUSHCHEV WITH THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR POLITICAL STRATEGY . INEVITABLY, WESTERN DIPLOMATS SPECULATED WHETHER THE RED CHINESE AND THE SOVIETS WOULD SEVER PARTY CONNECTIONS OR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, CARRY THE FEUD TO A SUMMIT SESSION OF WORLD COMMUNIST LEADERS, OR MERELY AGREE TO CONTINUE TO BE DISAGREEABLE . WHATEVER HAPPENED, THE GRAVEST SCHISM IN THE HISTORY OF COMMUNISM WAS AT HAND .\n",

AT THE AIRPORT, WHEN A WESTERN CORRESPONDENT ASKED TENG HSIAO-PING, THE CHIEF OF PEKING'S DEPARTING DELEGATION, HOW THE TALKS HAD GONE, HE REPLIED, \" VERY GOOD . \" OBVIOUSLY, THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE . DURING THEIR LAST WEEK IN MOSCOW, WHILE WESTERN NEGOTIATIORS WERE FETED AND FLATTERED, A KIND OF GREAT WALL SURROUNDED THE UNWELCOME VISITORS FROM PEKING . FROM THEIR ISOLATED COMPOUND ON MOSCOW'S LENIN HILLS, THE RED CHINESE DELEGATES VENTURED OUT ONLY IN CURTAINED BLACK CHAIKA LIMOUSINES FOR THE SHORT DRIVE TO PEKING'S EMBASSY ; ON ALTERNATE DAYS THEY MET WITH A SOVIET DELEGATION, OBVIOUSLY TO NO EFFECT . KHRUSHCHEV POINTEDLY STAYED AWAY FROM THE MEETINGS, ALTHOUGH HE WAS OTHERWISE ACTIVE IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND SOCIAL WHIRL . THE MOSCOW FILM FESTIVAL PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR LOTS OF PARTIES, AT WHICH WESTERN ENVOYS AND SOVIET FUNCTIONARIES MIXED AMIABLY WITH SUCH MOVIE STARS AS SHELLY WINTERS, SUSAN STRASBERG, YVES MONTAND AND SIMONE SIGNORET . AT WEEK'S END KHRUSHCHEV FINALLY TURNED TO HIS OTHER GUESTS AND, IN A RELATIVELY GRACIOUS GESTURE, TOSSED THE RED CHINESE A FAREWELL DINNER . ALTHOUGH DESCRIBED AS \" FRIENDLY, \" THE MEAL COULD HAVE PRODUCED LITTLE BEYOND DYSPEPSIA, FOR KHRUSHCHEV HAD SPOILED THE TABLE TALK IN ADVANCE, DELIVERING AN ORATORICAL BLAST AT PEKING THAT IN EFFECT DECLARED POLITICAL WAR ON THE CHINESE . THE CHALLENGE . AT A MASSIVE RALLY OF PARTY BUREAUCRATS AND PROPAGANDISTS IN THE KREMLIN'S PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES, KHRUSHCHEV SPOKE WITH SUCH APOPLECTIC VEHEMENCE THAT AT ONE POINT HE GROPED FOR WORDS AND RHETORICALLY BEGGED THE AUDIENCE : \" HELP ME OUT . \" BUT HE DIDN'T NEED MUCH HELP . ANGRILY DEFENDING HIS DESTALINIZATION DRIVE AGAINST PEKING'S ATTACKS, HE DEMANDED : \" WHAT DO THEY WANT ? TO FRIGHTEN OUR PEOPLE, TO BRING BACK THE DAYS WHEN A MAN WENT TO HIS JOB AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD SEE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AGAIN ? \" DROPPING HIS VOICE TO A DRAMATIC WHISPER, KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT LETTERS TO HIM FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR ENDING THE STALINIST TERROR . THEN HE ADDED :. \" IF STALIN HAD DIED TEN YEARS EARLIER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER . \" THE SOVIET BOSS WAS EQUALLY CONTEMPTUOUS ON THE SUBJECT OF PEKING'S WARMONGERING FOREIGN POLICY . \" THEY SAY ONE SHOULD START A REVOLUTION, A WAR, \" HE SHOUTED, \" AND ON THE CORPSES AND THE RUINS, A MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY WILL BE CREATED . AND WHO WOULD REMAIN IN THIS PROSPEROUS SOCIETY ? WOULDN'T THE LIVING ENVY THE DEAD ? \" DIRECTLY ACCUSING THE CHINESE OF TRYING TO UNSEAT HIM, KHRUSHCHEV DARED PEKING TO TAKE ITS CASE TO THE SOVIET PEOPLE : \" I DECLARE TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO OVERTHROW US I CHALLENGE YOU, COMRADES LET'S PICK OUT ANY PLANT OR COLLECTIVE FARM . YOU PRESENT YOUR PROGRAM AND WE WILL PRESENT OURS . YOU WON'T NEED ARMOR OR A PILLOW FOR PROTECTION . OUR PEOPLE ARE POLITE . THEY'LL LISTEN AND SAY : \" GET OUT OF HERE . / BOURGEOIS COMRADES . ALMOST AS VEHEMENT WAS A 19,000-WORD OPEN LETTER FROM THE KREMLIN THAT CALLED THE CHINESE LIARS, HYPOCRITES AND COWARDS . MOSCOW DISMISSED THE RED CHINESE CLAIM TO PROLETARIAN PURITY AND ACCUSED THEM OF TRYING TO GOAD RUSSIA INTO WAR WITH THE U.S . PRINTED IN PRAVDA, THE SOVIET COUNTERATTACK WAS ADDRESSED TO COMMUNIST CADRES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IT SERVED NOTICE THAT MOSCOW WOULD PUSH ITS PLATFORM BEFORE ALL 81 \" FRATERNAL \" PARTIES AT ALL COSTS . AS THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES ANGRILY POINTED OUT, PEKING WAS ACTIVELY \" ORGANIZING AND SUPPORTING BANDS OF RENEGADE \" REDS IN SEVEN NATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THE SINO-SOVIET QUARREL HAS SHARPLY DIVIDED LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTIES, SPLITTING RACE FROM RACE AND CONTINENT FROM CONTINENT . IN EUROPE THE QUARREL IS NOISIEST AMONG THE ITALIAN COMRADES . NOWHERE DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY SEEM MORE BOURGEOIS ; FOR JUST THAT REASON, NOWHERE IN EUROPE HAS PEKING FOUND MORE SUPPORTERS FOR ITS CREDO OF ALL-OUT REVOLUTION . IN PADUA A GROUP OF COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS, EXPELLED FOR FAVORING PEKING, PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET DENOUNCING RED BUREAUCRATS WHO LIVED THE SWEET LIFE, COMPLETE WITH \" WIVES AND MISTRESSES IN JEWELS AND FURS . \" SOME 30,000 ITALIAN REDS, MANY OF THEM SONS OF PROMINENT COMMUNISTS, HAVE FORMED ABOUT 20 CHAPTERS OF THE CHINESE-ITALIAN FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY . THE REBELS ARE BACKED BY FUNDS BELIEVED TO BE CHANNELED THROUGH THE ALBANIAN LEGATION IN ROME ; THEY CIRCULATE PROPAGANDA MATERIAL PREPARED BY RED CHINESE SPECIALISTS OPERATING FROM A FANCY VILLA IN BERN, SWITZERLAND . LAST WEEK COMMUNIST PARTY VICE SECRETARY LUIGI LONGO RUSHED TO MILAN TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION OF SINOPHILES, AND EXPLAINED THAT BY APPEARING MODERATE, ITALIAN REDS HAVE PROSPERED AT THE POLLS . AS HE EMERGED FROM THE MEETING, LONGO DISCOVERED THE SLOGANS \" VIVA STALIN, \" / VIVA MAO \" PAINTED ON NEARBY WALLS . AIRMAIL WAR . IN AFRICA AND ASIA THE SPLIT IS INCREASINGLY RACIAL . THE SOVIETS ARE COMPLAINING THAT AT THE RECENT ASIAN-AFRICAN SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE IN TANGANYIKA, A RED CHINESE OFFICIAL TOLD THE MOSCOW DELEGATION : \" THE WHITES HAVE NOTHING TO DO HERE . \" SUCH A BLATANT RACIST LINE, ARGUES MOSCOW, IS PURSUED IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS AT RUSSIA'S EXPENSE ; IT \" IMPLANTS THE SNEAKY IDEA THAT THE PEOPLES OF SOME REGIONS ARE MORE REVOLUTIONARY THAN OTHERS . \" INDIA'S COMMUNIST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN DEEPLY DIVIDED, BUT LAST WEEK FORMALLY LINED UP WITH KHRUSHCHEV, JUST AS AN INDIAN GOVERNMENT PURCHASING COMMISSION ARRIVED IN MOSCOW SHOPPING FOR ARMS TO BE USED IN DEFENSE AGAINST THE RED CHINESE . IN JAPAN, MOST OF WHOSE COMMUNISTS FAVOR RED CHINA FOR ETHNIC REASONS, THE STRUGGLE HAS BECOME PRETTY PETTY, RESULTING IN AN AIRMAIL CIRCULATION WAR . SOON AFTER PRAVDA BEGAN TO ARRIVE IN TOKYO BY AIR, PEKING'S PEOPLE'S DAILY DROPPED ITS SEAMAIL DELIVERY, WHICH USED TO TAKE A MONTH, AND ALSO TOOK TO THE AIR AT NO INCREASE IN POSTAL RATES TO SUBSCRIBERS .

AS FOR THE BEARD, FIDEL'S REVOLUTIONARY SYMPATHIES LIE WITH MAO, BUT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO BITE NIKITA'S HAND, AND LAST WEEK HE DUTIFULLY ENDORSED THE MOSCOW LINE . STILL, RED CHINA HAS NOT GIVEN UP HOPE OF CONVERTING CASTRO . CUBA IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE BOTH CHINESE AND RUSSIAN TECHNICIANS REMAIN AT WORK . THIS MONTH PEKING HAPPILY PROCLAIMED THAT ITS EXPERTS HAVE HELPED THE CUBANS TO RAISE 25,000 PEKING DUCKS . THESE SINO-SOVIET DUELS AROUND THE WORLD, AS MUCH AS THE FRUITLESS TALKS IN MOSCOW, HAVE SHATTERED ANY PROSPECT OF EARLY RECONCILIATION .

NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOW SUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WAS BOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERE NOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NO FURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCH MILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE, CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARS AND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS . PREMIERS AND PRINCES HAVE BEEN TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY STREET MOBS ; THOUSANDS OF POLITICIANS AND ARMY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HANGING, BEHEADING, FIRING SQUADS AND ASSASSINS ; AND SWARMS OF STUDENTS, WORKERS AND TRIBESMEN HAVE BEEN MOWED DOWN BY MACHINE GUNS AND BOMBS . IT WAS QUITE CLEAR LAST WEEK THAT THE LATEST SHAKE OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE RESULTED IN NEW PATTERNS AND ALIGNMENTS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELS PLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POURED INTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONG CONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARAB UNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, AND THE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTER OF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARAB STATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE AND ARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN, WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSER REBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUT HATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS AT THE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KING SAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LAST WEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDI ARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTS MAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THE SWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE IT COULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHEN AND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMID SERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS, YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKED SHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIAN SUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN AND OUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDI ARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT . NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHO RESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO INSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD IS INFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARE CAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS A FOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALL THE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICE OF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF \" VOICES \" (VOICE OF THE ARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICH BLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIAN ORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER . RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF SOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMED AT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING A NEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED AT DESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY, WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUT TO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UM KALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLY STIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILD THE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A NASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEM ARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDY SPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS . FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF SUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HE HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCE FEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS AND CONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT IS NASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARAB WORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THE MAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY . HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THE MIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENI TRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS . WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEP DESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIR CONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BEST HOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGION HANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIR DESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150 YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLS OF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE HEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WEST OVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT OR IMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE 16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS AND PASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WAR I, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS AND FOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES, MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, AND FRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THE COLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARAB NATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WAS SECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS AND BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL \" INVENTED \" THE STATE OF JORDAN \" ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . \" EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THE PARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS . HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT . HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THE MASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABS IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THAT ONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROM COLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTS AND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVED THAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLY ON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLY ORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'S ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY AS POPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEW SKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ON THE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THE STATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OF WHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICH WERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINET EL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ON THE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE ERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE, CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLOD UNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHT BRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIR GRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED, AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY AND DILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROM CAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THE NIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITOR SELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THE CAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED, WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK . SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMES THE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THE JEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHIN AT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OF THE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THE FELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSER EGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP IN THE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, \" I COULDN'T CARE LESS . \" TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE, TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY 1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THE REGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLY ACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN SWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP, COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'S FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLD WAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS AN INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA IS FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILL INCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000 ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THE U.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF SURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE (AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S . FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACT IS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OF POWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHT UNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BE REDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 A YEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THE GOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARE NOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGN ENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FAR LESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITS EDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZE NASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNED BECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, \" IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE WOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . \" THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERY VILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TO PASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES . NASSER'S REVOLUTION HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY TOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS A NASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERE SHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HAS LARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRST LEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THEN DEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND IS PERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA AND OTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES, WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'S GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWO EVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARE CRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS . IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATION PRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS . IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUT MERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE BIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST (A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISH THE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED IN PREGNANCY . THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACED BY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITS BORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS . INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT DISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OF GENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OF ARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEW GOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENT YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS AND INTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED, MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIAN WHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS AND HOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THE BRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVER HIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL, CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, AND CLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLE ABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINET MINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDED SHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS A DAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLE WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT A DAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICS AND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WAS A MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HE OVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS \" NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE WITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . \" HE DEFINES REVOLUTION AS \" THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE, WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . \" THE BAATH SLOGAN, \" UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, \" WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATED BY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE OVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TO IRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THE PARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASS INTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OF MILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS A DEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF 14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN . NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMED TAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTO ACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITY WAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ON THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THE SAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATED AS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODED BY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIAN ECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVES TRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL . AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINET MINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRY SECESSION FROM THE U.A.R . IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THE MOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN 1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTER OF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'S COMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILED AND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS AND PRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNIST ALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSER OFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONE WANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL RECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARAB UNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TO ACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, \" PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON A PROPER BASIS . \" MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : \" JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE WELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES AND RULERS . \" IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HE INTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATED UNION WITH SYRIA . \" THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, \" NASSER TOLD TIME LAST WEEK, \" WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION AND AMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES . \" TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIAN DELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH NASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED, HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE . THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TO CAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO . IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITH HARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING EVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS \" RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . \" SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATES WOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THAT THEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKS BETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHING CONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST, TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT . THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . IN DAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISON CELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS AS IDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . \" WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITH NASSER THE WAY WE WANT, \" HE SAID . \" WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPT THE WAY NASSER WANTS . \" BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINT MAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONS IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITION SQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR AN ADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES . ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HAS GIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : \" NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HIS HEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OF EXTERNAL EXPANSION . \" THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'S DREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UP ONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HER BORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO . MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WEST BANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN . BRITAIN'S PRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZING NASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THE BRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY, BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EAST COLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . \" NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OIL IS AMBIGUOUS, \" COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . \" OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . \" BRITISH AND U.S . OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'S INTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF 6,500,000 BBL . \" WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, \" SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL., BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRODUCER'S PROFITS . \" ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY, \" EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . \" IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITY AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . \" DRAWN LINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUS AT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HAS TURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN CAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOT INCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS AT ASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BE SINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOOD OF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HAS AIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUT THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . \" IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, \" SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S . CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB WORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO A PRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD . GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HIS EARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH \" IMPERIALIST \" GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEAN DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE \" KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDER JOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WE FACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS . / HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, \" IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S . STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFT A GOOD IMPRESSION . \" PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVE BECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . \" WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, \" SAYS NASSER . \" WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONEST AND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER . \" THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHO SPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HIS BRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS . THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S . DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : \" I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA . YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . \" JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END IN CAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BE WHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HE HAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HE APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OF JIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.S A DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HE STILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : \" I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTED HELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TO SAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD TECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . \" EVEN MORE THAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGING FROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( \" BETTER THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS \" ) . THERE ARE PROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER, OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, \" THE CAMEL DRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . \" BUT PROVERBS ARE ECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT WHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL, BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . FOR OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONS INVOLVED, ONLY HIS IN EGYPT HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED FOR A FULL TEN YEARS .\n",

FOR HOURS, TEACHER AND PUPIL PORED OVER ARITHMETIC PRIMERS, ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND FASHION MAGAZINES . ONE EVENING FULLER-SANDYS GAZED AT HER IN A SPECIAL WAY ; SHE SAID YES AND IN ENGLISH . PROMPTLY FULLERSANDYS CALLED ON HER GNARLED FATHER, AN AGED AND RESPECTED LABORER ON THE PLACE . NATURALLY, FULLER-SANDYS HANDED OVER A BRIDE PRICE ($100) ; THEN FULLER-SANDYS SLIPPED A DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING ON MARGARET'S FINGER . IT WAS A BRAVE STEP IN WHITE-RULED SOUTHERN RHODESIA . IMMEDIATELY THE GOVERNMENT FIRED FULLER-SANDYS AS AN ADVISER IN THE NATIVE AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, CURTLY EXPLAINING : \" YOU CANNOT ADMINISTER AFRICANS AND SLEEP WITH THEM . \" OF 48 WHITE FRIENDS FULLER-SANDYS INVITED TO THE WEDDING LAST WEEK, 34 SENT THEIR REGRETS . THE BEAMING BRIDE, CARRYING A BOUQUET OF WHITE DAHLIAS AND WEARING A WHITE SATIN GOWN, HAD THREE AFRICAN BRIDESMAIDS FOR THE CEREMONY ON FULLER-SANDYS'S VERANDA, PERFORMED BY THE REV . RICHARD HUGHES, RECTOR OF AN ANGLICAN CHURCH AT QUE QUE 64 MILES AWAY . THAT NIGHT, UNDER A FULL MOON, THE WEDDED COUPLE ATTENDED AN AFRICAN CELEBRATION IN THEIR HONOR . THERE WAS MUCH LEAP-DANCING AND YELLING AROUND A CAMPFIRE . DURING THE EVENING FULLER-SANDYS HAD A CHANCE TO OPEN A LETTER DELIVERED TO HIM EARLIER IN THE DAY . BEARING NEITHER RETURN ADDRESS NOR SIGNATURE, IT SAID, \" YOU BLOODY WHITE KAFFIR, WHAT A DISGRACE TO THE COUNTRY YOU ARE . . . YOUR BELOVED BLACK BASTARD ISN'T EVEN GOOD LOOKING . \" HE READ THE NOTE, THEN HANDED IT TO HIS BRIDE . AFTER A MOMENT, SHE REPLIED QUIETLY : \" IT DOESN'T MATTER, DEAR . /\n",

HE SUPPORTED A TROUPE OF 30 DANCING GIRLS AND A STRING OF 20 THOROUGHBREDS AND WORKED DILIGENTLY TO IMPROVE THE BREED . SPORTS ARE HIS LATEST CRAZE . HE CAPTAINS A CHAMPIONSHIP VOLLEYBALL TEAM AND RECENTLY DUNKED IN 92 POINTS IN A BASKETBALL GAME . ECCENTRIC AND MERCURIAL HE MAY BE, BUT CAMBODIA'S PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK, 41, IS ALSO ONE OF THE SHREWDEST LEADERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . SIHANOUK WAS CAMBODIA'S YOUNG KING UNTIL 1955, WHEN HE STEPPED DOWN FROM THE THRONE TO RUN FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE IN THE GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THE \" TRUE FACE OF THE PEOPLE WAS HIDDEN FROM ME . / UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, CAMBODIA HAS EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM OF DEVELOPMENT . LAST YEAR THE RICE CROP WAS THE BEST IN MEMORY, AND A RECORD EXPORTABLE SURPLUS OF 400,000 TONS WAS PREDICTED . CAMBODIA DOES NOT HAVE ONE RIEL OF EXTERNAL DEBT, AND ITS CURRENCY IS 100 PER CENT COVERED BY GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE (V . 50 PER CENT IN THE U.S.) ; 25 PER CENT OF THE BUDGET IS SPENT ON EDUCATION, ONE OF THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES IN THE WORLD . \" SOCIALIST MAJESTIES . \" BUT CAMBODIA, LIKE MANY PLEASANT AND LANGUID PLACES, IS NOW BESET BY PRESSING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS . THE PLANNED $26 MILLION DEFICIT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR HAS UNEXPECTEDLY DOUBLED, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SO SHORT OF CASH THAT THE CURRENT FIVE YEAR PLAN IS LITERALLY OUT OF MONEY . SOME $24 MILLION WORTH OF PUBLIC PROJECTS HAVE HAD TO BE CANCELED, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES ARE DWINDLING AT THE RATE OF $1,500,000 A MONTH . SIHANOUK'S REACTION WAS CHARACTERISTICALLY UNPREDICTABLE ; HE PURGED HIS GOVERNMENT OF ITS OLDTIMERS AND INSTALLED IN THEIR PLACES A GROUP OF HIS MOST FIERY CRITICS . THEY ARE YOUTHFUL (AVERAGE AGE : 36), LEFT-WING, PARIS-TRAINED INTELLECTUALS WHOM SIHANOUK SNEERINGLY CALLS \" THEIR SOCIALIST MAJESTIES . \" SAYS SIHANOUK : \" I KNOW THAT THEY DO NOT LIKE ME . THEY HATE ME . THEY HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE COMMUNISTS . NOW I'VE GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SUPPORTING CAMBODIA FOR THE FIRST TIME . I TOLD THEM, \" YOU CAN KILL ME, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO KILL CAMBODIA . \" ' WHAT'S GOOD FOR G . M . . . . BEHIND SIHANOUK'S ODD CHOICE OF MINISTERS IS AN ADROIT POLICY . WITH OPPONENTS IN HIS VERY CABINET, SIHANOUK IS ABLE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FOES, AND TO FORCE THEM TO SHARE BLAME FOR A WORSENING FINANCIAL SITUATION . HE HAS ALLOWED THE CABINET TO SLASH GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES, BUT VETOED ITS PROPOSAL TO NATIONALIZE THE FRENCH RUBBER PLANTATIONS, WHICH ARE A PRIME SOURCE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE . \" THE FRENCH MIGHT BE CAPITALISTS, \" SIHANOUK SAID, / BUT THEY ARE CAPABLE . \" HE ALSO DELIGHTS IN POINTING OUT TO HIS LEFT-LEANING INTELLECTUALS THE FAILURE OF CAMBODIA'S RED CHINESE-BUILT FACTORIES . \" THEY ONLY COST US MONEY, \" SIHANOUK SAYS . \" I TELL MY CABINET THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT FORD OR GENERAL MOTORS WOULD DO . \" THOUGH HE DEALS ROUGHLY WITH CAMBODIA'S NATIVE COMMUNISTS, SIHANOUK ARTFULLY REFUSES TO JOIN EITHER THE COMMUNIST OR WESTERN CAMPS . HOPING TO KEEP HIM NEUTRAL, THE U.S . HAS WEIGHED IN WITH $300 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, TO THIS NATION OF 5,700,000 PEOPLE, AND RUSSIA HAS BUILT A 500-BED HOSPITAL AND SENT INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT . CURRENTLY, NEUTRALIST SIHANOUK LEANS TOWARD MORE WESTERN INFLUENCE IN HIS COUNTRY, FOR HE FEELS THAT A COUNTERBALANCE IS NEEDED AGAINST THE RISING STRENGTH OF THE COMMUNISTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . BUT THE MAIN OBJECT OF SIHANOUK'S POLICY IS STILL TO \" MAINTAIN THE JOIE DE VIVRE OF MY PEOPLE . I WANT THEM TO WORK ALSO, BUT NOT SO HARD AS COMMUNISTS . WE CAMBODIANS ARE NOT ANIMALS OR MACHINES .

      "     Preview: COVER) AT 6 : 30 ONE MORNING EARLY THIS MONTH, A PHONE SHRILLED IN THE SMALL OFFICE OFF THE BEDROOM OF EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . ALREADY AWAKE, HE LIFTED THE RECEIVER TO HEAR EXCITING NEWS : A MILITARY COUP HAD JUST BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST THE ANTI-NASSER GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN . IT WAS THE MINISTER OF CULTURE AND NATIONAL GUIDANCE . HOW SHOULD RADIO CAIRO HANDLE THE SYRIAN CRISIS ? SUPPORT THE REBELS, SNAPPED NASSER . THEN EGYPT'S BOSS RAPPED OUT A SUCCESSION OF TELEPHONED COMMANDS . TO THE AIR FORCE : ALERT THE BOMBERS AND FIGHTERS IN CASE THE SYRIAN REBELS CALL FOR HELP . TO THE NAVY (SIX DESTROYERS AND TEN SUBMARINES) : STEAM NORTHWARD AND AWAIT ORDERS . TO THE ARMY : PREPARE TO MOVE IN CASE THE ISRAELIS MIGHT BE THINKING OF INTERVENTION ; PLACE MISSILES ON LAUNCH PADS READY TO FIRE . THIS DONE, NASSER FINISHED DRESSING AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN, LONG DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD . PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF, WHO ONLY FOUR WEEKS BEFORE HAD OVERTHROWN ANOTHER ANTI-NASSER REGIME IN IRAQ, SOLICITOUSLY ASKED WHAT NASSER INTENDED DOING ABOUT SYRIA . NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOW SUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WAS BOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERE NOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NO FURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCH MILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE, CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARS AND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS . PREMIERS AND PRINCES HAVE BEEN TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY STREET MOBS ; THOUSANDS OF POLITICIANS AND ARMY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HANGING, BEHEADING, FIRING SQUADS AND ASSASSINS ; AND SWARMS OF STUDENTS, WORKERS AND TRIBESMEN HAVE BEEN MOWED DOWN BY MACHINE GUNS AND BOMBS . IT WAS QUITE CLEAR LAST WEEK THAT THE LATEST SHAKE OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE RESULTED IN NEW PATTERNS AND ALIGNMENTS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELS PLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POURED INTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONG CONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARAB UNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, AND THE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTER OF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARAB STATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE AND ARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN, WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSER REBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUT HATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS AT THE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KING SAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LAST WEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDI ARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTS MAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THE SWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE IT COULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHEN AND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMID SERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS, YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKED SHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIAN SUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN AND OUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDI ARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT . NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHO RESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO INSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD IS INFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARE CAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS A FOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALL THE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICE OF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF \" VOICES \" (VOICE OF THE ARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICH BLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIAN ORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER . RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF SOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMED AT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING A NEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED AT DESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY, WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUT TO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UM KALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLY STIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILD THE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A NASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEM ARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDY SPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS . FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF SUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HE HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCE FEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS AND CONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT IS NASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARAB WORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THE MAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY . HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THE MIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENI TRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS . WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEP DESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIR CONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BEST HOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGION HANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIR DESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150 YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLS OF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE HEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WEST OVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT OR IMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE 16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS AND PASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WAR I, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS AND FOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES, MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, AND FRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THE COLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARAB NATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WAS SECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS AND BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL \" INVENTED \" THE STATE OF JORDAN \" ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . \" EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THE PARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS . HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT . HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THE MASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABS IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THAT ONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROM COLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTS AND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVED THAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLY ON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLY ORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'S ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY AS POPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEW SKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ON THE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THE STATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OF WHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICH WERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINET EL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ON THE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE ERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE, CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLOD UNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHT BRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIR GRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED, AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY AND DILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROM CAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THE NIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITOR SELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THE CAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED, WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK . SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMES THE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THE JEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHIN AT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OF THE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THE FELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSER EGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP IN THE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, \" I COULDN'T CARE LESS . \" TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE, TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY 1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THE REGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLY ACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN SWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP, COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'S FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLD WAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS AN INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA IS FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILL INCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000 ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THE U.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF SURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE (AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S . FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACT IS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OF POWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHT UNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BE REDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 A YEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THE GOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARE NOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGN ENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FAR LESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITS EDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZE NASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNED BECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, \" IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE WOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . \" THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERY VILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TO PASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES . NASSER'S REVOLUTION HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY TOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS A NASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERE SHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HAS LARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRST LEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THEN DEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND IS PERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA AND OTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES, WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'S GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWO EVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARE CRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS . IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATION PRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS . IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUT MERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE BIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST (A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISH THE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED IN PREGNANCY . THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACED BY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITS BORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS . INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT DISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OF GENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OF ARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEW GOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENT YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS AND INTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED, MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIAN WHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS AND HOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THE BRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVER HIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL, CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, AND CLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLE ABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINET MINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDED SHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS A DAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLE WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT A DAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICS AND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WAS A MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HE OVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS \" NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE WITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . \" HE DEFINES REVOLUTION AS \" THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE, WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . \" THE BAATH SLOGAN, \" UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, \" WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATED BY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE OVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TO IRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THE PARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASS INTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OF MILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS A DEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF 14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN . NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMED TAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTO ACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITY WAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ON THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THE SAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATED AS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODED BY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIAN ECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVES TRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL . AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINET MINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRY SECESSION FROM THE U.A.R . IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THE MOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN 1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTER OF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'S COMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILED AND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS AND PRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNIST ALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSER OFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONE WANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL RECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARAB UNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TO ACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, \" PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON A PROPER BASIS . \" MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : \" JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE WELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES AND RULERS . \" IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HE INTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATED UNION WITH SYRIA . \" THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, \" NASSER TOLD TIME LAST WEEK, \" WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION AND AMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES . \" TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIAN DELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH NASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED, HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE . THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TO CAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO . IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITH HARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING EVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS \" RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . \" SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATES WOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THAT THEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKS BETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHING CONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST, TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT . THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . IN DAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISON CELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS AS IDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . \" WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITH NASSER THE WAY WE WANT, \" HE SAID . \" WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPT THE WAY NASSER WANTS . \" BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINT MAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONS IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITION SQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR AN ADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES . ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HAS GIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : \" NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HIS HEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OF EXTERNAL EXPANSION . \" THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'S DREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UP ONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HER BORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO . MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WEST BANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN . BRITAIN'S PRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZING NASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THE BRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY, BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EAST COLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . \" NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OIL IS AMBIGUOUS, \" COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . \" OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . \" BRITISH AND U.S . OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'S INTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF 6,500,000 BBL . \" WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, \" SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL., BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRODUCER'S PROFITS . \" ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY, \" EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . \" IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITY AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . \" DRAWN LINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUS AT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HAS TURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN CAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOT INCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS AT ASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BE SINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOOD OF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HAS AIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUT THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . \" IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, \" SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S . CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB WORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO A PRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD . GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HIS EARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH \" IMPERIALIST \" GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEAN DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE \" KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDER JOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WE FACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS . / HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, \" IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S . STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFT A GOOD IMPRESSION . \" PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVE BECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . \" WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, \" SAYS NASSER . \" WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONEST AND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER . \" THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHO SPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HIS BRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS . THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S . DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : \" I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA . YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . \" JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END IN CAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BE WHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HE HAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HE APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OF JIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.S A DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HE STILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : \" I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTED HELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TO SAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD TECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . \" EVEN MORE THAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGING FROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( \" BETTER THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS \" ) . THERE ARE PROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER, OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, \" THE CAMEL DRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . \" BUT PROVERBS ARE ECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT WHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL, BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . FOR OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONS INVOLVED, ONLY HIS IN EGYPT HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED FOR A FULL TEN YEARS .\n",

WITHIN THREE DAYS, PRO-NASSER LIEUT . GENERAL LOUAI ATTASSI WAS NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE SYRIAN COUNCIL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND, AND THE COUNCIL ITSELF WAS ENLARGED TO ADMIT A NASSERITE MAJORITY .

IN CAME JORDAN'S \" MAN OF CRISES, \" FIVE-TIME PRIME MINISTER SAMIR RIFAI, 62, WHO HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING IN RECENT MONTHS FOR MORE DEMOCRACY INSIDE JORDAN AND AN END TO ANTAGONISM AGAINST NASSER . WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ? AFTER A LATE NIGHT TALK, KING HUSSEIN AND RIFAI AGREED ON A NEW GOVERNMENT, LOOKING TOWARD PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND HUSSEIN'S EVENTUAL RETIREMENT TO THE FIGUREHEAD ROLE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH . THEY EVEN GINGERLY ACCEPTED THE NASSER-BAATH SLOGAN OF \" FREEDOM, UNITY, SOCIALISM, \" WITH ONLY THE SLIGHT AMENDMENT OF THE FINAL WORD TO READ \" A BETTER LIFE . \" WHAT WAS STILL UNCERTAIN LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER NASSER IS PREPARED TO DROP OR MODIFY HIS PRESENT DETERMINATION TO UNITE ONLY WITH \" LIBERATED \" ARAB STATES AND TO SHUN MONARCHIES . SAID NEW JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER RIFAI : \" WE HAVE OUR PRIDE . WE ARE JUST AS HEALTHY AND STRONG AS ANY ARAB STATE . WE DON'T INTEND TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING, BUT WE DO INTEND TO PROCLAIM OUR GOOD WILL AND OUR ATTACHMENT TO ARAB UNITY . \" THEN HE ADDED HOPEFULLY, \" THERE'S EVERY REASON FOR THE NEW ARAB UNION TO WELCOME JORDAN AND NO REASON TO BAR A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY .

HE LOST MUCH OF HIS CLAIM FOR THE TITLE OF ARAB LEADERSHIP IN 1961, WHEN AN ARMY COUP WRENCHED SYRIA FROM ITS SHORT-LIVED MERGER WITH EGYPT IN THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . THAT LEFT NASSER WITHOUT A SINGLE ARAB ALLY, AND SURROUNDED BY SUCH VIRULENT ENEMIES AS IRAQ'S DICTATOR KASSEM AND THE KINGS OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA . THEN CAME LAST MONTH'S IRAQI REVOLUTION AND THE OVERTHROW OF KASSEM . NO ONE COULD BLAME EGYPT'S LEADER FOR HARKING BACK TO OLD DREAMS OF ARAB GRANDEUR, FOR THIS NEW MAN IN BAGHDAD PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF WAS A FORMER NASSER PROTEGE DEDICATED TO PANARAB UNITY . TRIBUTE TO MOTHER . WITH THIS IN MIND, NASSER MOUNTED A PLATFORM IN CAIRO'S VAST REPUBLIC SQUARE LAST WEEK TO CELEBRATE THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEFUNCT UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . STRINGS OF RAMADAN LIGHTS OUTLINED THE MOSQUES AND MINARETS, AND A CROWD OF 20,000 JAMMED THE SQUARE PROTECTED FROM THE COLD NIGHT AIR BY A SIWAN, A \" HALL \" ROOFED AND WALLED BY BRIGHTLY COLORED CANVAS . \" UNION ! UNION ! UNION ! NASSER ! NASSER ! NASSER ! \" ROARED THE MOB . WHAT IT GOT WAS A LITTLE LESS THAN NASSER HAD HOPED FOR . THE LEADERS OF THE IRAQI DELEGATION TO THE CELEBRATION, DEPUTY PREMIER ALI SALEH SAADI AND FOREIGN MINISTER TALIB HUSSEIN SHABIB, WERE CORDIAL ENOUGH, BUT THEY WERE FAR FROM SPECIFIC . SAADI DUTIFULLY PAID TRIBUTE TO EGYPT AS THE \" MOTHER REPUBLIC \" OF THE ARAB WORLD, BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR UNION, HE URGED ONLY A /FRANK RAPPROCHEMENT \" BETWEEN CAIRO AND BAGHDAD . WAS THIS ENOUGH SURE, CRIED NASSER IN HIS OWN SPEECH . TODAY, HE DECLARED / THERE IS A UNITY OF OBJECTIVES BETWEEN THE REVOLUTION IN BAGHDAD AND THE REVOLUTION IN CAIRO, \" AND \" WE DO NOT NEED TREATIES OR CONSTITUTIONAL FORMS TO PROVE THIS UNITY . \" JAIL FOR THE DOG . IN BAGHDAD, NEW PRESIDENT AREF AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE TOO BUSY LEARNING HOW TO RUN A COUNTRY TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION . THE SLAIN KASSEM, NOW DUBBED \" THE MAD TYRANT, \" HAD QUARRELED WITH ALL HIS NEIGHBORS . AREF WAS RESTORING TRADE RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, IMPORTS FROM LEBANON AND EXPORTS TO LITTLE KUWAIT, THE OIL-RICH PRINCIPALITY KASSEM ONCE TRIED TO TAKE OVER . TIDYING UP ANOTHER NATIONAL PROBLEM, AREF SENT A HELICOPTER NORTH TO PICK UP TWO DELEGATES OF THE KURDISH REBELS IN THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE BLOODY CIVIL WAR THAT HAS TIED UP HALF THE 75,000-MAN IRAQI ARMY ; HE EVEN MADE FRIENDLY OVERTURES TO THE U.S.-BRITISH CONTROLLED IRAQ PETROLEUM CO., WHICH KASSEM HAD ALIENATED . AS FOR THE COMMUNISTS OF BAGHDAD, THEY WERE STILL GOING INTO JAILS . THE RESULT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SINGLE RED PROPAGANDA BARRAGES SINCE THE REDS CHARGED THE U.S . WITH USING GERM WARFARE IN KOREA . PRAVDA'S CORRESPONDENT CLAIMED, \" I SAW TANKS CRUSH WOMEN AND CHILDREN, \" AND REPORTED THE \" PHYSICAL ANNIHILATION OF HUNDREDS, PERHAPS THOUSANDS, OF IRAQI DEMOCRATS AND PATRIOTS . \" THE PRAVDA MAN WENT LOOKING FOR AZIZ SHARIF, A 1962 LENIN PEACE PRIZEWINNER AT THE OFFICE OF THE PEACE PARTISANS LEAGUE (A EUPHEMISM FOR RED MILITIA) . A SOLDIER ON GUARD AT THE OFFICE TOLD HIM, \" THAT DOG HAS LONG SINCE BEEN JAILED . \" THE SOVIET RED CROSS EVEN APPEALED TO THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO HELP PROTECT COMMUNISTS, WHOM IT PREFERRED TO CALL \" THE DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS VICTIMIZED BY BLOODY PERSECUTION IN IRAQ . \" WHEN THE FIRST HECTIC DAYS WERE OVER, THE NOVICES WOULD GET AROUND TO ANSWERING GAMAL ABDEL NASSER'S CRY FOR UNION . AT WEEK'S END IRAQ'S THINKING WAS SUMMED UP BY FOREIGN MINISTER SHAHIB, WHO PROPOSED A JOINT MEETING OF THE FOUR \" LIBERATED \" ARAB STATES (IRAQ, EGYPT, YEMEN, ALGERIA) TO \" COORDINATE WORK AMONG THEM IN VARIOUS FIELDS WITH A UNIONIST REVOLUTIONARY AND SOCIALIST TENDENCY .\n",

      "     Preview: COVER) AT 6 : 30 ONE MORNING EARLY THIS MONTH, A PHONE SHRILLED IN THE SMALL OFFICE OFF THE BEDROOM OF EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . ALREADY AWAKE, HE LIFTED THE RECEIVER TO HEAR EXCITING NEWS : A MILITARY COUP HAD JUST BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST THE ANTI-NASSER GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN . IT WAS THE MINISTER OF CULTURE AND NATIONAL GUIDANCE . HOW SHOULD RADIO CAIRO HANDLE THE SYRIAN CRISIS ? SUPPORT THE REBELS, SNAPPED NASSER . THEN EGYPT'S BOSS RAPPED OUT A SUCCESSION OF TELEPHONED COMMANDS . TO THE AIR FORCE : ALERT THE BOMBERS AND FIGHTERS IN CASE THE SYRIAN REBELS CALL FOR HELP . TO THE NAVY (SIX DESTROYERS AND TEN SUBMARINES) : STEAM NORTHWARD AND AWAIT ORDERS . TO THE ARMY : PREPARE TO MOVE IN CASE THE ISRAELIS MIGHT BE THINKING OF INTERVENTION ; PLACE MISSILES ON LAUNCH PADS READY TO FIRE . THIS DONE, NASSER FINISHED DRESSING AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN, LONG DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD . PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF, WHO ONLY FOUR WEEKS BEFORE HAD OVERTHROWN ANOTHER ANTI-NASSER REGIME IN IRAQ, SOLICITOUSLY ASKED WHAT NASSER INTENDED DOING ABOUT SYRIA . NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOW SUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WAS BOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERE NOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NO FURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCH MILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE, CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARS AND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS . PREMIERS AND PRINCES HAVE BEEN TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY STREET MOBS ; THOUSANDS OF POLITICIANS AND ARMY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HANGING, BEHEADING, FIRING SQUADS AND ASSASSINS ; AND SWARMS OF STUDENTS, WORKERS AND TRIBESMEN HAVE BEEN MOWED DOWN BY MACHINE GUNS AND BOMBS . IT WAS QUITE CLEAR LAST WEEK THAT THE LATEST SHAKE OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE RESULTED IN NEW PATTERNS AND ALIGNMENTS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELS PLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POURED INTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONG CONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARAB UNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, AND THE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTER OF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARAB STATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE AND ARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN, WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSER REBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUT HATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS AT THE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KING SAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LAST WEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDI ARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTS MAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THE SWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE IT COULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHEN AND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMID SERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS, YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKED SHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIAN SUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN AND OUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDI ARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT . NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHO RESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO INSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD IS INFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARE CAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS A FOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALL THE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICE OF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF \" VOICES \" (VOICE OF THE ARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICH BLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIAN ORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER . RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF SOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMED AT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING A NEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED AT DESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY, WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUT TO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UM KALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLY STIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILD THE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A NASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEM ARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDY SPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS . FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF SUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HE HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCE FEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS AND CONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT IS NASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARAB WORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THE MAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY . HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THE MIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENI TRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS . WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEP DESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIR CONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BEST HOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGION HANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIR DESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150 YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLS OF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE HEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WEST OVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT OR IMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE 16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS AND PASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WAR I, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS AND FOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES, MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, AND FRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THE COLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARAB NATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WAS SECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS AND BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL \" INVENTED \" THE STATE OF JORDAN \" ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . \" EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THE PARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS . HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT . HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THE MASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABS IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THAT ONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROM COLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTS AND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVED THAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLY ON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLY ORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'S ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY AS POPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEW SKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ON THE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THE STATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OF WHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICH WERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINET EL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ON THE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE ERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE, CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLOD UNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHT BRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIR GRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED, AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY AND DILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROM CAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THE NIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITOR SELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THE CAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED, WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK . SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMES THE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THE JEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHIN AT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OF THE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THE FELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSER EGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP IN THE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, \" I COULDN'T CARE LESS . \" TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE, TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY 1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THE REGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLY ACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN SWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP, COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'S FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLD WAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS AN INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA IS FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILL INCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000 ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THE U.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF SURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE (AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S . FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACT IS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OF POWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHT UNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BE REDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 A YEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THE GOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARE NOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGN ENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FAR LESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITS EDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZE NASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNED BECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, \" IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE WOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . \" THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERY VILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TO PASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES . NASSER'S REVOLUTION HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY TOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS A NASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERE SHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HAS LARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRST LEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THEN DEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND IS PERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA AND OTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES, WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'S GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWO EVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARE CRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS . IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATION PRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS . IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUT MERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE BIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST (A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISH THE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED IN PREGNANCY . THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACED BY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITS BORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS . INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT DISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OF GENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OF ARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEW GOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENT YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS AND INTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED, MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIAN WHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS AND HOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THE BRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVER HIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL, CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, AND CLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLE ABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINET MINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDED SHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS A DAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLE WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT A DAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICS AND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WAS A MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HE OVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS \" NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE WITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . \" HE DEFINES REVOLUTION AS \" THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE, WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . \" THE BAATH SLOGAN, \" UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, \" WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATED BY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE OVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TO IRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THE PARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASS INTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OF MILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS A DEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF 14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN . NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMED TAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTO ACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITY WAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ON THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THE SAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATED AS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODED BY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIAN ECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVES TRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL . AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINET MINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRY SECESSION FROM THE U.A.R . IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THE MOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN 1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTER OF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'S COMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILED AND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS AND PRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNIST ALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSER OFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONE WANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL RECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARAB UNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TO ACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, \" PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON A PROPER BASIS . \" MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : \" JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE WELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES AND RULERS . \" IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HE INTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATED UNION WITH SYRIA . \" THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, \" NASSER TOLD TIME LAST WEEK, \" WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION AND AMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES . \" TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIAN DELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH NASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED, HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE . THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TO CAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO . IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITH HARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING EVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS \" RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . \" SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATES WOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THAT THEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKS BETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHING CONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST, TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT . THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . IN DAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISON CELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS AS IDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . \" WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITH NASSER THE WAY WE WANT, \" HE SAID . \" WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPT THE WAY NASSER WANTS . \" BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINT MAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONS IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITION SQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR AN ADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES . ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HAS GIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : \" NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HIS HEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OF EXTERNAL EXPANSION . \" THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'S DREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UP ONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HER BORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO . MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WEST BANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN . BRITAIN'S PRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZING NASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THE BRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY, BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EAST COLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . \" NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OIL IS AMBIGUOUS, \" COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . \" OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . \" BRITISH AND U.S . OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'S INTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF 6,500,000 BBL . \" WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, \" SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL., BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRODUCER'S PROFITS . \" ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY, \" EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . \" IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITY AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . \" DRAWN LINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUS AT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HAS TURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN CAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOT INCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS AT ASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BE SINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOOD OF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HAS AIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUT THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . \" IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, \" SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S . CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB WORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO A PRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD . GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HIS EARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH \" IMPERIALIST \" GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEAN DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE \" KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDER JOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WE FACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS . / HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, \" IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S . STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFT A GOOD IMPRESSION . \" PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVE BECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . \" WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, \" SAYS NASSER . \" WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONEST AND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER . \" THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHO SPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HIS BRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS . THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S . DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : \" I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA . YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . \" JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END IN CAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BE WHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HE HAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HE APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OF JIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.S A DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HE STILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : \" I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTED HELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TO SAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD TECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . \" EVEN MORE THAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGING FROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( \" BETTER THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS \" ) . THERE ARE PROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER, OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, \" THE CAMEL DRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . \" BUT PROVERBS ARE ECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT WHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL, BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER .

IT WAS NOT UNTIL MOMENTS LATER THAT THEY SPOTTED HIM, A CHUNKY MAN IN A NONDESCRIPT BUSINESS SUIT, PATIENTLY EXAMINING THE MODERNISTIC INTERIOR OF THE DULLES TERMINAL BUILDING . THE COMMITTEE'S MISTAKE, AND THE GENERAL'S DEMEANOR, WERE BOTH SIGNIFICANT . THOUGH THE ELDEST SON OF CHIANG KAI-SHEK, NATIONALIST CHINA'S VENERABLE PRESIDENT, CHIANG CHING-KUO, 53, IS THE MYSTERY MAN OF FORMOSA WHO AVOIDS THE LIMELIGHT . PARTLY, THE MYSTERY HAS PROFESSIONAL REASONS : AS CHIEF OF FORMOSA'S SECRET POLICE AND HEAD OF THE GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES DIRECTED AGAINST RED CHINA, HE NATURALLY SEEKS THE SHADOWS . FORMOSAN BESTSELLER . THE VISIT TO THE U.S., HIS FIRST IN TEN YEARS, IS SAID TO BE WITHOUT SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE . HE CONFERRED WITH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AT BOTH THE CIA AND THE PENTAGON, DISCUSSED THE LATEST ESTIMATES OF CONDITIONS ON THE RED CHINESE MAINLAND . BETWEEN CONFERENCES, HE SQUEEZED IN A ONE-DAY JET FLIGHT TO CAPE CANAVERAL . HE ALSO HAD A 75-MINUTE CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND PRESENTED HIM WITH A COPY OF PROFILES IN COURAGE IN A CHINESE TRANSLATION, ADDING THAT IT WAS A BESTSELLER ON FORMOSA . KENNEDY AND TOP U.S . OFFICIALS WERE SEEING FACE TO FACE THE MAN WHO MAY WELL SUCCEED HIS FATHER AS PRESIDENT OF NATIONALIST CHINA . ON FORMOSA, CHINGKUO IS KNOWN AS \" LITTLE CHIANG, \" AND HIS ONLY MAJOR RIVAL FOR THE TOP JOB IS VICE PRESIDENT CHEN CHENG, WHO SUFFERS FROM A LIVER AILMENT AND HAS BEEN IN SEMIRETIREMENT SINCE JUNE . BORN IN CHEKIANG PROVINCE TO THE GIMO'S FIRST WIFE, A PEASANT GIRL WHO WAS LATER KILLED IN A JAPANESE BOMBING RAID, CHING-KUO WAS 16 WHEN THE GIMO SENT HIM TO MOSCOW IN 1925 \" TO LEARN MORE ABOUT REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS . \" HE JOINED THE KOMSOMOL AND STUDIED GUERRILLA TACTICS AT A RED ARMY ACADEMY . WHEN CHIANG KAI-SHEK BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN 1927, A LETTER OVER CHING-KUO'S NAME APPEARED IN PRAVDA DENOUNCING HIS FATHER AS A \" TRAITOR . \" HE SAYS THE LETTER WAS A FORGERY . CHING-KUO HIMSELF BROKE WITH STALIN ON THE ISSUE OF TROTSKYISM AND PUT IN SOME YEARS OF HARD WORK IN GOLD MINES AND FACTORIES . WHEN THE JAPANESE THREAT FORGED A NEW BOND BETWEEN STALIN AND THE GIMO IN 1937, CHING-KUO WAS PERMITTED TO LEAVE FOR CHINA WITH HIS SHY, APPEALING RUSSIAN WIFE FANINA AND THEIR SON ALAN . SPOT & MOP . OVERJOYED AT HIS SON'S RETURN, THE GIMO NEVERTHELESS THOUGHT HIM TOO RUSSIAN IN HIS OUTLOOK AND HAD HIM TUTORED FOR TWO YEARS TO \" MAKE HIM CHINESE AGAIN . \" EVER SINCE, CHING-KUO HAS LOYALLY AND EFFICIENTLY HANDLED A SUCCESSION OF JOBS FOR HIS FATHER, RANGING FROM OPERATING A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR COMMUNIST SUSPECTS ON GREEN ISLAND TO CREATING A SYSTEM OF POLITICAL COMMISSARS TO CHECK ON LOYALTY IN THE ARMY . UNDER CHING-KUO, NATIONALIST GUERRILLAS PROBE THE MAINLAND FOR SOFT SPOTS IN THE DEFENSES AND PUBLIC DISAFFECTION WITH THE RED REGIME . OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, SOME 1,500 MEN HAVE BEEN PUT ASHORE IN CHEKIANG AND KWANGTUNG PROVINCES . IN U.S . OPINION, INDIVIDUAL SABOTEURS OFTEN COMPLETE THEIR MISSIONS, BUT MOST LARGE RAIDING PARTIES HAVE BEEN QUICKLY SPOTTED AND MOPPED UP BY THE RED CHINESE . CHING-KUO HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN ACCUSED OF ENGAGING IN SECRET TALKS WITH PEKING, PRESUMABLY WITH THE OBJECT OF MAKING A DEAL AFTER THE GIMO'S DEATH . THOSE WHO KNOW HIM BEST SCOFF AT THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD EVER HAND FORMOSA OVER TO PEKING . SINO-MARXIST AMALGAM .

HE IS BACKED BY HIS DASHING HALF BROTHER, MAJOR GENERAL CHIANG WEI-KUO, 47 . AS MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO IN THE CABINET AND SPECIAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT, CHINGKUO WORKS CLOSELY WITH HIS FATHER . ANOTHER SOURCE OF STRENGTH IS CHING-KUO'S 100,000-MAN YOUTH CORPS, AND HIS VETO POWER OVER PROMOTIONS IN THE ARMY GIVES HIM ENORMOUS INFLUENCE WITH JUNIOR OFFICERS . WITH HIS TWO OLDER CHILDREN MARRIED, CHING-KUO LIVES IN A MODEST HOME IN TAIPEI WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNGER SONS . HIS DAY BEGINS AT 6 : 00 A.M . WITH AN HOUR'S PRACTICE IN CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY AND PAINTING, AND CONTINUES IN HIS OFFICE UNTIL MIDNIGHT .

TRYING TO MAKE THE SOVIET LEADER SWEAT, CASTRO IS OBVIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO BOOST HIS PRICE FOR SUPPORTING RUSSIA IN ITS STRUGGLE WITH THE CHINESE . BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT CUBA WILL ULTIMATELY SIGN THE TREATY, FOR CASTRO NEEDS RUSSIA TO BUY HIS 3,800,000-TON SUGAR CROP AND TO CONTINUE STEADY TRANSFUSION OF ECONOMIC AID . THE LONELY ONES . THE SOLE NONSIGNER IN THE WESTERN CAMP IS FRANCE . EVEN FRANCO SPAIN, THE ONLY WESTERN COUNTRY WHICH DOES NOT HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW, HAS SIGNED THE TREATY, LEAVING FRANCE ISOLATED FROM ALL ITS CONTINENTAL NEIGHBORS . MOST GALLING TO CHARLES DE GAULLE WAS WEST GERMANY'S DECISION TO SIGN THE PACT AFTER A REASSURING PITCH IN BONN BY U.S . SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK . BONN'S ACTION WAS DOUBLY UPSETTING TO FRANCE, FOR IT FOLLOWED AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT GERMANY AND THE U.S . WILL COOPERATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW BATTLE TANK (TIME, AUG . 16) ; JUST THREE MONTHS AGO, PARIS WAS UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GERMANS ON A SIMILAR PROJECT . BOTH BONN DECISIONS RAISED THE QUESTION OF JUST HOW MUCH THE FRANCO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATY IS WORTH, AND BROUGHT INTO THE OPEN THE FACT THAT WEST GERMANY STILL LOOKS TO THE U.S . AND NOT TO FRANCE FOR LEADERSHIP . STUBBORNLY FRANCE PREPARED FOR ANOTHER ATOMIC TEST IN THE SAHARA, BUT DE GAULLE'S ASPIRATIONS TO FRENCH LEADERSHIP OF EUROPE WERE ACIDLY DEMOLISHED BY PARIS' LE FIGARO . \" IF KHRUSHCHEV REALLY BECOMES DISTURBED BY THE CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED AGAINST HIM BY CHINA, \" SAID THE PAPER, \" AND IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A CERTAINTY OF PEACE ON HIS WESTERN FRONT, THEN HE WILL NOT COME TO SEEK AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE, WHICH IS NEGLIGIBLE IN HIS EYES, EVEN WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS, BUT WITH THE U.S., WHOSE INFLUENCE AND POWER ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES SUPERIOR .

THE PHONE RANG AGAIN, LONG DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD . PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF, WHO ONLY FOUR WEEKS BEFORE HAD OVERTHROWN ANOTHER ANTI-NASSER REGIME IN IRAQ, SOLICITOUSLY ASKED WHAT NASSER INTENDED DOING ABOUT SYRIA . NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOW SUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WAS BOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERE NOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NO FURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCH MILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE, CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARS AND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS . PREMIERS AND PRINCES HAVE BEEN TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY STREET MOBS ; THOUSANDS OF POLITICIANS AND ARMY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HANGING, BEHEADING, FIRING SQUADS AND ASSASSINS ; AND SWARMS OF STUDENTS, WORKERS AND TRIBESMEN HAVE BEEN MOWED DOWN BY MACHINE GUNS AND BOMBS .

THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELS PLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POURED INTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONG CONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARAB UNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, AND THE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTER OF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARAB STATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE AND ARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN, WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSER REBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUT HATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS AT THE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KING SAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LAST WEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDI ARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTS MAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THE SWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE IT COULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISE TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHEN AND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMID SERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS, YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKED SHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIAN SUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN AND OUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDI ARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT . NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHO RESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO INSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD IS INFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARE CAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS A FOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALL THE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICE OF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF \" VOICES \" (VOICE OF THE ARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICH BLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIAN ORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER . RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF SOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMED AT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING A NEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED AT DESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY, WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUT TO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UM KALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLY STIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILD THE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A NASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEM ARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDY SPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS . FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF SUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HE HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCE FEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS AND CONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT IS NASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARAB WORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THE MAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY . HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THE MIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENI TRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS . WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEP DESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIR CONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BEST HOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGION HANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIR DESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150 YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLS OF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE HEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WEST OVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT OR IMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE 16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS AND PASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WAR I, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS AND FOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES, MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, AND FRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THE COLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARAB NATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WAS SECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS AND BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL \" INVENTED \" THE STATE OF JORDAN \" ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . \" EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THE PARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS . HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT . HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THE MASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABS IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THAT ONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROM COLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTS AND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVED THAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLY ON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLY ORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'S ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY AS POPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEW SKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ON THE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THE STATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OF WHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICH WERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINET EL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ON THE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE ERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE, CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLOD UNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHT BRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIR GRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED, AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY AND DILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROM CAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THE NIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITOR SELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THE CAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED, WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK . SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMES THE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THE JEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHIN AT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OF THE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THE FELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSER EGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP IN THE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, \" I COULDN'T CARE LESS . \" TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE, TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY 1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THE REGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLY ACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN SWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP, COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'S FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLD WAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS AN INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA IS FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILL INCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000 ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THE U.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF SURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE (AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S . FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACT IS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OF POWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARD THE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHT UNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BE REDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 A YEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THE GOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARE NOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGN ENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FAR LESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITS EDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZE NASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNED BECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, \" IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE WOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . \" THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERY VILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TO PASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES . NASSER'S REVOLUTION HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY TOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS A NASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERE SHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HAS LARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRST LEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THEN DEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND IS PERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA AND OTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES, WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'S GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWO EVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARE CRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS . IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATION PRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BE BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS . IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUT MERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE BIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST (A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISH THE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED IN PREGNANCY . THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACED BY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITS BORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS . INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT DISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OF GENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OF ARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEW GOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENT YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS AND INTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED, MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIAN WHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS AND HOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THE BRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVER HIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL, CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, AND CLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLE ABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINET MINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDED SHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS A DAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLE WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT A DAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICS AND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WAS A MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HE OVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS \" NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE WITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . \" HE DEFINES REVOLUTION AS \" THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE, WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . \" THE BAATH SLOGAN, \" UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, \" WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATED BY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE OVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TO IRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THE PARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASS INTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OF MILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS A DEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF 14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN . NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMED TAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTO ACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITY WAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ON THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THE SAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATED AS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODED BY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIAN ECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVES TRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL . AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINET MINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRY SECESSION FROM THE U.A.R . IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THE MOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN 1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTER OF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'S COMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILED AND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS AND PRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNIST ALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSER OFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA . THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONE WANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO IS ANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL RECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARAB UNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TO ACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, \" PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON A PROPER BASIS . \" MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : \" JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE WELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES AND RULERS . \" IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HE INTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATED UNION WITH SYRIA . \" THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, \" NASSER TOLD TIME LAST WEEK, \" WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION AND AMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES . \" TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIAN DELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH NASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED, HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE . THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TO CAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO . IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITH HARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING EVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS \" RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . \" SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATES WOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THAT THEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKS BETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHING CONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST, TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT . THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . IN DAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISON CELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS AS IDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . \" WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITH NASSER THE WAY WE WANT, \" HE SAID . \" WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPT THE WAY NASSER WANTS . \" BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINT MAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONS IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITION SQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR AN ADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES . ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HAS GIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : \" NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HIS HEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OF EXTERNAL EXPANSION . \" THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'S DREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UP ONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HER BORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO . MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WEST BANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN . BRITAIN'S PRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZING NASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THE BRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY, BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EAST COLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . \" NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OIL IS AMBIGUOUS, \" COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . \" OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . \" BRITISH AND U.S . OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'S INTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF 6,500,000 BBL . \" WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, \" SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL., BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRODUCER'S PROFITS . \" ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY, \" EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . \" IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITY AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . \" DRAWN LINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUS AT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HAS TURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN CAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOT INCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS AT ASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BE SINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOOD OF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HAS AIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUT THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . \" IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, \" SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S . CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB WORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO A PRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD . GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HIS EARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH \" IMPERIALIST \" GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEAN DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE \" KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDER JOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WE FACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS . / HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, \" IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S . STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFT A GOOD IMPRESSION . \" PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVE BECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . \" WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, \" SAYS NASSER . \" WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONEST AND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER . \" THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHO SPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HIS BRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS . THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S . DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : \" I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA . YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . \" JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END IN CAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BE WHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HE HAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HE APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OF JIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.S A DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HE STILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : \" I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTED HELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TO SAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD TECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . \" EVEN MORE THAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGING FROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( \" BETTER THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS \" ) . THERE ARE PROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER, OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, \" THE CAMEL DRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . \" BUT PROVERBS ARE ECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT WHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL, BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . FOR OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONS INVOLVED, ONLY HIS IN EGYPT HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED FOR A FULL TEN YEARS .\n",

THEY EVEN GINGERLY ACCEPTED THE NASSER-BAATH SLOGAN OF \" FREEDOM, UNITY, SOCIALISM, \" WITH ONLY THE SLIGHT AMENDMENT OF THE FINAL WORD TO READ \" A BETTER LIFE . \" WHAT WAS STILL UNCERTAIN LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER NASSER IS PREPARED TO DROP OR MODIFY HIS PRESENT DETERMINATION TO UNITE ONLY WITH \" LIBERATED \" ARAB STATES AND TO SHUN MONARCHIES . SAID NEW JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER RIFAI : \" WE HAVE OUR PRIDE . WE ARE JUST AS HEALTHY AND STRONG AS ANY ARAB STATE . WE DON'T INTEND TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING, BUT WE DO INTEND TO PROCLAIM OUR GOOD WILL AND OUR ATTACHMENT TO ARAB UNITY . \" THEN HE ADDED HOPEFULLY, \" THERE'S EVERY REASON FOR THE NEW ARAB UNION TO WELCOME JORDAN AND NO REASON TO BAR A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY .

DESPISED BY COLOR-CONSCIOUS WHITES, WHOM THEY GREATLY OUTNUMBER (400,000 TO 96,000), RESENTED BY EAST AFRICA'S 25 MILLION BLACKS, THE ASIANS MOSTLY INDIANS AND PAKISTANIS ARE LOATH TO RETURN TO HOMELANDS THAT FEW HAVE SEEN, AND WHERE JOBS ARE ALREADY CRITICALLY SCARCE . FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF ASIANS, THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO STAY ON IN AN INCREASINGLY HOSTILE AFRICA WHERE, AS ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT SUCCINCTLY SAID RECENTLY, THEY ARE \" THE HARD UPPER RUNG AGAINST WHICH THE RISING AFRICAN BUMPS HIS HEAD . \" EXPORTING PROFITS . THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN TRADING ON THE EAST COAST OF AFRICA FOR CENTURIES, MOST OF EAST AFRICA'S ASIANS HAVE TAKEN ROOT IN THIS ALIEN LAND ONLY SINCE 1895, WHEN THE BRITISH BROUGHT IN 32,000 INDIAN WORKMEN TO BUILD THE NARROW-GUAGE RAILWAY THAT OPENED THE INTERIOR TO COLONIZATION . ASIAN QUICKLY TURNED FROM RAILROAD BUILDING TO TRADE, AND SO COMPLETELY DOMINATED COMMERCE THAT UNTIL 1919 THE RUPEE WAS THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY OF EAST AFRICA . TODAY, MILLIONAIRE INDIAN MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OCCUPY SOME OF NAIROBI'S FINEST HOMES ; BUT THE ASIANS ARE FOR THE MOST PART SMALL SHOPKEEPERS DUKA WALLAHS TO THE AFRICANS AND JUNIOR CIVIL SERVANTS, WHO HAVE NEVER FOUND MIDDLECLASS SECURITY IN THEIR MIDDLE-CLASS VOCATIONS . AFRICAN NATIONALISTS HAVE LONG COMPLAINED THAT THE ASIANS ARE A CLANNISH, ALIEN PEOPLE WHOSE ONLY INTEREST IN AFRICA LIES IN THE PROFITS TO BE WRUNG FROM AFRICAN CUSTOMERS . \" THE INDIANS ARE OPPORTUNISTS AND QUISLINGS, \" CRIES NYASALAND'S PRIME MINISTER HASTINGS BANDA . \" EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THEY ARE TAKING BUSINESS FROM AFRICAN BUSINESSMEN . \" THE ASIANS MAKE A HABIT OF SHIPPING MUCH OF THEIR PROFIT OUT OF AFRICA ; AFRICAN POLITICIANS CHARGED BITTERLY LAST FALL THAT THEIR TRUE LOYALTY WAS DISCLOSED BY THE SUMS OF MONEY THAT THEY RAISED FOR INDIA DURING THE BORDER WAR WITH CHINA .

LATELY, KENYA'S INDIAN MERCHANTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED HEAVILY TO BOTH BIG AFRICAN POLITICAL PARTIES IN HOPES OF BUYING PROTECTION AFTER KENYA GETS UHURU (FREEDOM) . KENYA'S NATIONALIST LEADER TOM MBOYA IS ONE OF THE FEW POLITICIANS TO PLEDGE THAT HIS KENYA AFRICAN NATIONAL UNION WILL PERMIT NOT ONE TO BE \" VICTIMIZED ON GROUNDS OF RACE, COLOR, TRIBE OR RELIGION . \" BUT EVEN MBOYA ADDS BLANDLY, \" WE OF COURSE WISH TO SEE ASIANS AND OTHER NON-AFRICANS ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE NEW ORDER BY ACCEPTING AFRICAN LEADERSHIP AND AFRICAN GOVERNMENT . /\n",

UP AND DOWN THE PERSIAN GULF, THE STATES OF QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND IRAN WERE ROLLING IN OIL WEALTH . BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, ABU DHABI'S 25,000 SQ . MI . OF SAND, DATE PALMS AND BARREN OFFSHORE ISLANDS JUST GOT HOTTER, MORE HUMID AND WINDSWEPT THAN BEFORE . PERPETUAL TRUCE . BUT THEN ALLAH RESPONDED TO THE SHEIK'S PRAYERS BELATEDLY, BUT IN OVERWHELMING MEASURE . TWO VAST OILFIELDS HAVE BEEN TAPPED BY BRITISH DRILLING TEAMS, ONE AT MURBAN IN THE SANDY INTERIOR, THE OTHER IN THE SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS OF THE GULF . CONSERVATIVE OILMEN ESTIMATE ABU DHABI'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES AT ABOUT 3.8 BILLION BBL., WHICH AT PRESENT ROYALTY RATES WOULD RETURN SOME $1.4 BILLION OVER THE YEARS . RIDICULOUS, SAY OTHER EXPERTS : ON THE BASIS OF LATEST DISCOVERIES, RESERVES MAY BE AS GREAT AS 38 BILLION BBL . THIS HAS ALL BEEN RATHER UNSETTLING TO ABU DHABI, WHOSE 15,000 BEDOUINS HAVE GOT ALONG FOR CENTURIES ON PIRACY, PEARL FISHING AND INTERTRIBAL RAIDS . IN THE 19TH CENTURY, THE SWIFT PIRATE DHOWS WERE SWEPT FROM THE GULF BY BRITAIN, WHICH ESTABLISHED \" A PERPETUAL MARITIME TRUCE \" HENCE THE NAME TRUCIAL STATES, GIVEN TO ABU DHABI AND SIX OTHER SHEIKDOMS . PEARL FISHING BECAME UNPROFITABLE WHEN THE JAPANESE CLEVERLY INTRODUCED CULTURED PEARLS TO THE WORLD . THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO ABU DHABI BUT INTRIGUE : OF THE TWELVE PREDECESSORS OF THE PRESENT SHEIK, ONLY THREE DIED PEACEFULLY IN THEIR PALACE BEDS . THE REST WERE EITHER MURDERED OR VIOLENTLY DEPOSED, USUALLY BY CLOSE RELATIVES . SHEIK SHAKHBUT TOOK OVER IN 1928 WHEN HIS UNCLE WAS ASSASSINATED, AFTER HAVING EARLIER KILLED SHAKHBUT'S FATHER WHO, IN TURN, HAD COME TO POWER BY KILLING HIS OLDER BROTHER . SHAKHBUT IS SAID TO HAVE RULED SO LONG AND SAFELY ONLY BECAUSE HIS OWN TWO BROTHERS SWORE A SOLEMN OATH ON THE KORAN NOT TO MURDER HIM . BUGS IN THE TREASURY . IN HIS LONG YEARS OF OIL-LESS RULE, SHEIK SHAKHBUT RAN HIS COUNTRY ON CUSTOMS DUTIES OF $140,000 A YEAR, FOUGHT SOME DESULTORY WARS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS IN SHARJA AND DUBAI, AND LIVED QUIETLY IN HIS MUD-WALLED PALACE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND . HE INSTALLED AN AIR CONDITIONER IN HIS BEDROOM BUT SELDOM USED IT BECAUSE HE DISLIKED THE NOISE . HE ALSO PUT IN A FLUSH TOILET AND A PUMP TO SUPPLY IT WITH WATER ; SEWAGE DISPOSAL WAS SIMPLY A PIPE JUTTING OUT FROM THE PALACE WALL . NEARLY EVERY DAY, THE SHEIK SAT CROSSLEGGED IN HIS THRONE ROOM HOLDING A MAJLIS, AT WHICH HE LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS OF CITIZENS, WHILE BEDOUIN CHIEFS GROUPED AROUND HIM, SOME HOLDING ON THEIR WRISTS THE HOODED FALCONS THAT WERE ABU DHABI'S ONLY STATUS SYMBOL . WHEN THE OIL REVENUES BEGAN TO FLOW IN LAST YEAR, EVERYONE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS OF SHEIK SHAKHBUT . BUT IT SOON DEVELOPED THAT WHAT SHAKHBUT LIKED TO DO WITH MONEY WAS COUNT IT, NOT SPEND IT . HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT CHECKS FROM THE OIL COMPANIES, AT FIRST KEPT HIS CASH UNDER HIS BED . WHEN THE BEDSPRINGS BEGAN TO BULGE, HE HAD THE CASH CARTED TO A PALACE DUNGEON . IT WAS ONLY AFTER RATS BEGAN NIBBLING AT THE TREASURE CHESTS AND INSECTS STARTED EATING THE FOLDING MONEY THAT SHAKHBUT RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF BANKING . HE NOW FLOURISHES AN OUTSIZE CHECKBOOK, EMBLAZONED WITH THE RED AND WHITE FLAG OF ABU DHABI, BUT HE STILL HATES TO SIGN CHECKS . PUTTING OFF PAYDAY . BRITAIN, WHICH HAS A MOTHER-HEN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ALLEGEDLY INDEPENDENT TRUCIAL STATES, LAST YEAR PROMOTED AN ABU DHABI DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CALLING FOR $70 MILLION WORTH OF ROADS, SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC WORKS . SHEIK SHAKHBUT, 58, ACCEPTED THE PLAN ONLY IN THEORY.BUSINESSMEN DEALING WITH THE SHEIK HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERNIGHT GREY HAIR . \" HE SIMPLY ASKS FOR 50 PER CENT IN EVERY BUSINESS DEAL ! / SPUTTERED A LEVANTINE ENTREPRENEUR . SHAKHBUT MAY AMIABLY CONCEDE THAT HE HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR WORK TO BE DONE, THEN ADDS CAGILY, \" BUT I DIDN'T SAY I WOULD PAY FOR IT . \" HIS PENNY PINCHING EVEN EXTENDS TO ABU DHABI'S 470-MAN ARMY : EACH SOLDIER IS PAID PERSONALLY BY SHAKHBUT, WHO STALLS OFF PAYDAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE . THE SHEIK'S MIND RESEMBLES A REVOLVING DOOR . SINCE ABU DHABI HAS VIRTUALLY NO WATER (A GLASS OF WATER COSTS ABOUT THE SAME AS A GLASS OF GIN), THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR MODERN EQUIPMENT TO DISTILL SEA WATER . BUT THE SHEIK HAS THREE TIMES SHIFTED THE LOCATION OF A PROPOSED NEW DISTILLATION PLANT AND MAY WELL SHIFT IT THREE OR 30 TIMES MORE . GROANED A FRUSTRATED BRITISH ENGINEER : \" WE FREQUENTLY DO SIX WEEKS' WORK FOR NOTHING . \" THE BRITISH PRODUCED PLANS TO MAKE ABU DHABI CITY INTO A GLITTERING MODERN CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE THE PRIDE OF THE PERSIAN GULF, BUT AS FAST AS ENGINEERS LAY OUT A NEW BOULEVARD, SHAKHBUT GRANTS PERMISSION TO A LOCAL MERCHANT TO BUILD A STORE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT . FISHY FRESHNESS . IN AN EFFORT TO BROADEN THE SHEIK'S OUTLOOK, OILMEN AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE GIVEN HIM REDCARPET TRIPS TO PARIS, LONDON AND NEW YORK . WHAT INTERESTED HIM MOST WAS THE LARGE NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILES IN THE THREE CITIES . \" KEEP THE CARS GOING, \" HE SAID EARNESTLY, THINKING HAPPILY OF THE FUTURE CONSUMPTION OF ABU DHABI GASOLINE . NEW YORK CITY STRUCK HIM AS A \" TOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT CIVILIZED . THEY LIVE LIKE ANTS OR SWALLOWS IN CLIFFS . THE SUN NEVER GETS DOWN INTO THE STREETS . \" HE WAS APPALLED BY TV WESTERNS : \" ALL THAT SHOOTING UPSETS THE BASIS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT ! \" WHAT DELIGHTS SHAKHBUT IS THE TRADITIONAL LIFE OF HIS PEOPLE . \" THE THING THAT PLEASES ME MOST, \" HE SAYS, \" IS HUNTING FOR BUSTARDS WITH OUR FALCONS . IT'S TREMENDOUS TO SEE THE FALCON FIGHTING THE BUSTARD AND KILLING IT . EACH FALCON HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL OWNER AND REFUSES TO HUNT FOR ANYONE ELSE . \" THE SHEIK IS ALSO A CONNOISSEUR OF CAMEL'S MILK HIS ONLY DRINK AND CAN TELL BY THE MILK'S TASTE WHAT THE CAMEL HAS BEEN EATING AND WHERE IT WAS IN THE DESERT FOR THE BEST MILK, HE EXPLAINS, WE FEED CAMELS ON SEA MANGROVE AND DRIED FISH . THIS GIVES THE MILK A SLIGHTLY FISHY FRESHNESS WE APPRECIATE . \" SHAKHBUT ONCE OWNED A CADILLAC, BUT WHEN IT FINALLY BROKE DOWN HE JUST ABANDONED IT . NOW HE MAKES HIS STATE VISITS IN A BONE-JARRING LAND-ROVER, BUT WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM . \" I DID ALL MY TRAVELING BY CAMEL IN THE OLD DAYS, \" HE SIGHS, \" BUT NOW I HAVE TO GO BY CAR BECAUSE IF THE RULER WENT BY CAMEL, PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT PECULIAR . /\n",

WHETHER BREAKING UP A RACE RIOT OR GINGERLY PLUCKING ANTI-NUCLEAR SQUATTERS FROM THE PAVEMENT, THE BRAWNY, PINK-CHEEKED BOBBY ALMOST NEVER RESORTS TO THE PANICKY BRUTALITY OF THE FRENCH FLIC OR THE OFFICIOUS ZEAL OF THE GERMAN POLIZIST . BRITAIN'S POLICE, ARMED ONLY WITH A NIGHT STICK, STILL BELIEVE IN POUNDING A BEAT . ITS STREETS AND PARKS AFTER DARK ARE AMONG THE WORLD'S SAFEST ; AND WHILE AN ENGLISH HOUSEHOLDER IS AWAY ON VACATION, LIKELY AS NOT THE BOBBIES WILL KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FRONT DOOR . BUT IN RECENT YEARS, AND PARTICULARLY SINCE THE PROFUMO-KEELER-WARD SCANDALS, BRITONS HAVE COME TO SUSPECT THAT THEIR POLICE ARE NOT ONLY MARKEDLY LESS PROFICIENT AT KEEPING THE QUEEN'S PEACE THAN OF OLD, BUT MAY ALSO HAVE BECOME LESS SCRUPULOUS IN UPHOLDING THE TRADITIONALLY HIGH STANDARDS OF BRITISH JUSTICE . SMARTER CROOKS . WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING CRIME, IT IS STILL ELEMENTARY TO CALL IN SCOTLAND YARD . LAST WEEK, LED BY SUCH WISE OLD BLUEBOTTLES AS COMMANDER GEORGE HATHERILL, 65, THE YARD'S DEAN OF SLEUTHS, WHO SPEAKS EIGHT LANGUAGES AND HAS SOLVED 17 MURDERS, YARD MEN INVESTIGATING THE GREAT BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TRAIN ROBBERY SUCCEEDED IN ROUNDING UP NINE SUSPECTS, RECOVERED $761,367 OF THE $7,000,000 LOOT . ALSO ON HAND WERE ERNEST MILLEN, BOSS OF THE FLYING SQUAD, ALIAS THE HEAVY MOB, WHOSE 100-ODD SLEUTHS KNOW MORE ABOUT THE UNDERWORLD THAN DANTE ; AND THE TERRIBLE TWINS, TOP DETECTIVES TOM BUTLER AND PETER VIBART, WHO HAVE CRACKED MANY A BIG CASE TOGETHER . YET SO FAR AT LEAST, THE GANG'S RINGLEADERS WERE STILL AT LARGE . EVEN WITHOUT SUCH HUMILIATIONS AT THE HANDS OF MASTER CROOKS, THE LOT OF BRITAIN'S 76,530 POLICEMEN IS AN INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY ONE . THE NATION'S POLICE FORCES ARE CRITICALLY UNDERMANNED (AUTHORIZED STRENGTH : 82,313), SADLY UNDERPAID (SERGEANT'S PAY AVERAGES $3,000 A YEAR) AND, IN MANY CRITICS' EYES, UNDEREDUCATED . IN RECENT YEARS, POLICE RECRUITS HAVE INCLUDED NOT A SINGLE UNIVERSITY GRADUATE ; ONLY ABOUT 10 PER CALL NEW BOBBIES HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA . BRITISH CRIMINALS, BY CONTRAST, ARE BECOMING MORE IMAGINATIVE AND TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT EVERY YEAR . AS FOR SCOTLAND YARD, EVEN ITS STAUNCHEST ADMIRERS ADMIT THAT THE LEGEND TENDS TO OVERSHADOW PERFORMANCE . OF A RECORD NUMBER OF CRIMES REPORTED IN LONDON LAST YEAR, FEWER THAN 25 PER CENT WERE SOLVED ; POLICE HAVE RECOVERED NONE OF THE 700,000 STOLEN IN FOUR MAJOR ROBBERIES FROM ONE BANK DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS . IN THE WOODSHED . AS FOR THE PROFUMO CASE, THOUGH AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO ITS SECURITY ASPECTS IS NEARLY COMPLETE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN LITTLE ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL LESSEN WHAT THE ECONOMIST RECENTLY CALLED \" THE ALREADY CUMBROUS WEIGHT OF SUSPICION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NASTY IN THE WOODSHED . \" LAST WEEK THE LABOR PARTY'S \" SHADOW \" FOREIGN SECRETARY, PATRICK GORDON WALKER, CALLED FOR A ROYAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLES PLAYED THROUGHOUT BY THE GOVERNMENT, JUDICIARY AND POLICE . AMONG OTHER HINTS OF NASTINESS IN THE WOODSHED, OR THE POLICE STATION, BRITONS WERE PERTURBED BY RECENT CHARGES THAT SCOTLAND YARD HAD BROWBEATEN A CONVICTED PROSTITUTE INTO TESTIFYING AGAINST WARD (SHE LATER RECANTED), AND BY SPECULATION THAT POLICE DELIBERATELY FAILED TO PRODUCE A DEFENSE WITNESS AT THE TRIAL OF \" LUCKY \" GORDON, THE JAMAICAN SINGER WHO WAS IMPRISONED ON CHARGES OF BEATING CHRISTINE KEELER, AND LATER MYSTERIOUSLY FREED . SINCE THERE IS NO WATERTIGHT SEPARATION OF EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE POWERS IN BRITAIN'S UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION, THE DISQUIETING IMPLICATION TO MANY BRITONS WAS THAT, IN ITS EMBARRASSMENT OVER THE PROFUMO SCANDAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAD EXERTED EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE TO PUT WARD BEHIND BARS . IF SUCH SUSPICIONS ARE UNFAIR, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WOULD EVER BE FULLY INVESTIGATED, LET ALONE REFUTED . DANGER TO DEMOCRACY .E MANY OTHER LEGACIES OF 19TH CENTURY BRITAIN, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM SEEMS ALMOST TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED NOT TO WORK . TO SOME EXTENT, IT WAS . SIR ROBERT PEEL, WHO IN 1829 ORGANIZED THE FIRST MODERN FORCE (AND GAVE THE BOBBIES HIS NAME), ADMITTED TO GRAVE MISGIVINGS THAT IT MIGHT BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT OF TYRANNY . UNLIKE A SOLDIER OR CIVIL SERVANT, THE BRITISH POLICEMAN IS NOT A \" SERVANT OF THE CROWN \" BUT HAS THE AMBIGUOUS LEGAL STATUS OF A UNIFORMED CIVILIAN WHO IS MERELY PAID TO DO WHAT EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD DO ON HIS OWN . EVEN TO THIS DAY, MANY BRITONS BELIEVE THAT A STRONG, UNIFIED POLICE FORCE COULD LEAD TO A POLICE STATE . AS A RESULT, THEY HAVE 158 SEPARATE LOCAL FORCES WHOSE CHIEF CONSTABLES ARE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO THEMSELVES . WHEN A ROYAL COMMISSION IN 1962 RECOMMENDED CONTINUATION OF THIS SYSTEM, COMMISSION MEMBER A . L . GOODHART AN EMINENT U.S . JURIST WHO WAS THEN MASTER OF OXFORD'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OBJECTED THAT A SINGLE, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED POLICE NETWORK WOULD BE INFINITELY MORE EFFICIENT, AND MORE DEMOCRATIC, THAN THE \" EMPTY VELVET GLOVE \" WITH WHICH BRITAIN IS NOW TRYING TO DEFEAT ORGANIZED CRIME . \" THE DANGER IN A DEMOCRACY, \" SAID HE, \" DOES NOT LIE IN A CENTRAL POLICE THAT IS TOO STRONG BUT IN LOCAL POLICE FORCES THAT ARE TOO WEAK . \" IN DAY-TO-DAY POLICE WORK, THE LACK OF LIAISON BETWEEN FORCES MORE THAN 50 PER CENT HAVE FEWER THAN 350 MEN INEVITABLY HELPS THE CRIMINAL .

FOR THREE WEEKS, THE RED FORCES, REINFORCED BY CADRES OF VIET MINH TROOP COMMANDERS, MORTAR SPECIALISTS AND ARTILLERY ADVISERS FROM COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM, HAD BEEN NIBBLING AWAY AT NEUTRALIST POSITIONS AROUND THE 30-MILE PERIMETER OF THE GRASSY, POOL-TABLE-FLAT PLAINE DES JARRES . STRATEGICALLY PLACED IN THE CENTER OF LAOS, THE PLAIN NAMED AFTER THE ANCIENT STONE BURIAL JARS STILL FOUND IN THE AREA CONTROLS THE APPROACHES TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND IS THE PRIMARY ACCESS ROUTE TO NORTH VIET NAM . WITH THE PLAINE DES JARRES IN THEIR HANDS, THE REDS COULD SOLIDIFY THEIR HOLD ON ALL OF NORTHERN LAOS . LAST WEEK THIS GLOOMY PROSPECT WAS ALL BUT A FACT, AS 10,000 RED TROOPS POURED ONTO THE PLAIN, FORCING THE NEUTRALISTS TO ITS VERY EDGE . CIGARETTES & BULLETS . THE WEEK BEGAN WITH A DESPERATE FLIGHT TO THE PLAIN BY NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA, WHO HOPED IT STILL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO ARRANGE A CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST PATHET LAO AND NEUTRALIST ARMY CHIEF KONG LE . THINGS SEEMED CHEERY ENOUGH AS THE OPPOSING LEADERS EMBRACED AND THEIR TROOPS EXCHANGED CIGARETTES . BUT, AS ONE NEUTRALIST PUT IT, \" WE EXCHANGE CIGARETTES DURING THE DAY AND BULLETS AT NIGHT . \" ALL TOO TRUE . HARDLY HAD SOUVANNA DEPARTED WHEN THE TRUCE ABRUPTLY COLLAPSED . NO ONE KNOWS WHO FIRED FIRST, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PATHET LAO WAS SHOOTING, AND THE NEUTRALISTS WERE RUNNING . ON THE DUSTY PLAINE DES JARRES AIRSTRIP, MOTHERS BREASTFED DIRTY BABIES, AND CHILDREN SAGGED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF PARACHUTE PACKS CRAMMED WITH HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS AS THEY PATIENTLY WAITED FOR PLANES TO EVACUATE THEM TO THE LAOTIAN CAPITAL OF VIENTIANE, 120 MILES AWAY . IN HIS RAMSHACKLE, TIN-ROOFED HEADQUARTERS, GUARDED NIGHT AND DAY BY A PATROLLING PLATOON OF TANKS, KONG LE WORKED ROUND THE CLOCK DRAWING UP A BATTLE PLAN, ALTHOUGH WEAKENED BY A LIVER AILMENT AND A SERIOUS SINUS CONDITION . \" THIS, \" HE SAID, \" IS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN . \" MOVING OVER THE MOUNTAINTOPS AND THROUGH THE PASSES GIRDLING THE PLAIN, THE REDS AT LAST SURROUNDED THE SIX-MILE-LONG PLATEAU . FROM THE HEIGHTS, THE COMMUNISTS LAID A MORTAR BARRAGE ON THE AIRFIELD, KONG LE'S LAST REMAINING LIFELINE TO VIENTIANE . WITH THE AIRSTRIP INOPERABLE, KONG LE WAS FORCED TO RELY ON RUNNERS AS HIS PRIMARY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION ; HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL TOGETHER WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS SHATTERED FORCES AND MOVE OFF THE PLAIN . PRESSURE FROM TWO QUARTERS . KONG LE'S RETREAT CAUSED CONSTERNATION IN VIENTIANE . WITH HIS LEFT-RIGHT-CENTER COALITION FAST COMING UNSTUCK, PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA WAS FEARFUL THAT KONG LE'S TROOPS WOULD JOIN FORCES WITH A RIGHT-WING ARMY JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE PLAINE DES JARRES AND LAUNCH A JOINT COUNTERATTACK AGAINST THE REDS THAT WOULD SURELY PRECIPITATE CIVIL WAR . DESPERATELY HE APPEALED TO BRITAIN AND RUSSIA, OVERSEERS OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, FOR QUICK INTERVENTION TO STOP THE PATHET LAO'S FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF THE CEASE-FIRE . RUSSIA HESITATED TO INTERCEDE, FOR FEAR OF ALIENATING THE COMMUNISTS IN LAOS AND NORTH VIET NAM . SOVIET INTERVENTION AT THIS STAGE MIGHT TURN THEM INCREASINGLY TOWARD RED CHINA, RUSSIA'S RIVAL, FOR SUPPORT IN THEIR REVOLUTION . BUT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV WAS ALSO UNDER PRESSURE FROM A DIFFERENT QUARTER . IN WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT KENNEDY MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE EXPECTED MOSCOW TO PUT A STOP TO PATHET LAO PRESSURE AND LIVE UP TO THE GENEVA AGREEMENT . \" WE WILL, I THINK, HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DESTRUCTION OF THAT ACCORD WHETHER THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER SIGNATORIES ARE GOING TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, \" SAID KENNEDY . TOUGHER U.S . ACTION COULD NOT BE RULED OUT IF THE COMMUNISTS SHOWED SIGNS OF MOVING SOUTH FROM THE PLAINE DES JARRES INTO THE MEKONG RIVER VALLEY ITSELF . THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN THEIR SUPPLY ROUTES TO COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS FIGHTING IN NEIGHBORING SOUTH VIET NAM, WHERE THE U.S . IS DEEPLY COMMITTED WITH BOTH MEN AND MONEY . THOUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT DREADED THE THOUGHT OF ANY FURTHER MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, OFFICIALS MADE IT CLEAR THAT MORE TROOPS MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO THE AREA TO SAFEGUARD LAOTIAN NEUTRALITY .\n",

      "     Preview: IN AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH PARTNERS HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY MINDFUL OF ONE ANOTHER'S SENSITIVITIES, IN WHICH VICTORIES WERE TACTFULLY NOT CROWED OVER, AND TOGETHERNESS IN ITSELF WAS REGARDED AS A GOOD THING, CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK REMINDED THE WORLD OF WHAT ONE MAN WITH A WILL CAN DO . OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, ON HIS OWN PEOPLE AND ON THEIR NEIGHBORS, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS PERFECTED HIS NATIVE TALENT FOR HANDING OUT RUDE SURPRISES . EMPLOYING THE LOFTY DISDAIN THAT USED TO INFURIATE ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN, DE GAULLE SUCCEEDED IN INFURIATING KENNEDY, MACMILLAN AND A HOST OF OTHERS BY VETOING BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENTLE ABOUT IT, ALLOWING NEGOTIATIONS TO SPUTTER OUT IN A CONFUSION OF DETAILS . HE CHOSE TO BE BLUNT AND HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO SHUT OUT BRITAIN OR MERELY TO HUMILIATE HER . HE ALSO SHOOK THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE TO ITS ROOTS, SET OUT TO CONTEST ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO PUT IN QUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE U.S . IN EUROPE . FOR THE WEST ! HE CREATED A DRAMATIC HISTORICAL TURN, AN OBSCURE DESTINATION . DEAD MECHANISM . WESTERN EUROPE HEARD THE NEWS WITH ANGER AND DISMAY . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD BLAMED DE GAULLE FOR A \" BLACK DAY, \" DECLARING THAT \" THE COMMON MARKET IS NOW ONLY A MECHANISM AND NO LONGER A LIVING THING . \" ALFRED MULLERARMACK, WEST GERMANY'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR AT BRUSSELS, QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST . JEAN MONNET, THE DYNAMIC OPTIMIST WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE COMMON MARKET, LAMENTED THAT \" THERE NOW LOOMS DISUNION WITH ITS INHERENT DANGERS . \" BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN TOLD HIS COUNTRY ON TV : \" WHAT HAPPENED AT BRUSSELS WAS BAD . BAD FOR US, BAD FOR EUROPE, BAD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD . \" , \" BRUTAL \" WAS THE WORD HEARD MOST OFTEN IN WHITEHALL AND AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO DESCRIBE DE GAULLE'S BEHAVIOR . ARCHITECT OR AT LEAST CO-DESIGNERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, U.S . POLICYMAKERS WERE PLUNGED INTO GLOOM . \" MOST UNFORTUNATE, \" SAID THE STATE DEPARTMENT . IN CONGRESS THERE WERE REVIVED MUTTERINGS ABOUT THE INEFFICACY OF FOREIGN AID AND THE INGRATITUDE OF ALLIES . ARKANSAS' SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT TALKED OF THE \" TEMPORARY ABERRATION \" OF THE MAN . A NATION THAT HAD HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO PROFIT FROM THE COMMUNIST SPLIT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND RED CHINA FOUND A DEEP CREVICE OPENING AT ITS FEET . AND THOUGH THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SPEAK OF AN \" AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL \" OF ITS RELATIONS WITH A RECALCITRANT FRANCE AS JOHN FOSTER DULLES ONCE HAD U.S . MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC POLICY TOWARD EUROPE WAS PLAINLY IN NEED OF ONE . COMMUNITY TWILIGHT . EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN, AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED IN MOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATION OF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILL INEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR \" INNER CONTRADICTIONS . \" CRIED A RUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : \" THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OF STATE . \" NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONE TORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHED HIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20 YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT QUITE THIS WAY . PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE . THAT THEY DID IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 . HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES, SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT, TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE \" GRAND DESIGN, \" IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S . INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE, LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940 HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE \" STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . \" GARGANTUAN STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS . THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST, GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG . BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND 2) HAS \" SPECIAL TIES \" WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950, LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD . / MATTER OF DAYS . \" DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :. THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : \" IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR . THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE \" INSULAR, MARITIME \" BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO \" EUROPEANS \" BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S . WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE \" TROJAN HORSE \" FIRST BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING . NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF BRITAIN, GRUNTED, \" WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . \" A FRENCH DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, \" IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING . \" ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED, AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM . MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION, TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A \"MONSTROUS THING .\" DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED, HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  \"IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS,\" HE DECLARED .  \"IN REALITY, OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN . WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME, NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  \"IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED,\" HE SAID ,\"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT .\"  ADDED HEATH :\"THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS, THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF .\"  WHEN HE STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES, THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED 40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON MARKET (\"FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN,\" SAID A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME . IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT, TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, \"FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY . DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM WITHIN . SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES \"LONELY PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES .\" WHAT DISTURBS MANY AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS . DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE \"BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET .\" SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK, AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV, WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY . THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE TOLD AN AIDE, \" NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST PUSH IN EUROPE . \" THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE, AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, \" REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . \" ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST . HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN EUROPE, THE GRADUAL \" BOURGEOISATION \" OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES, WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, \" STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS . \" HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE . NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . \" AND, HE ARGUES, \" IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE . \" IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S . NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . \" I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE, BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . \" IN EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP . IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE \" COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE FREE WORLD . \" IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, \" THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . \" THE SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY . . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?\n",

AFTER THE DECISIONS AT NASSAU, A QUESTION MARK ROSE OVER THE FUTURE OF ITS MILITARY POWER . THE LATEST GALLUP POLL SHOWED LABOR LEADING THE TORIES 45 PER CENT TO 36 PER CENT . MANY OF MACMILLAN'S OWN CONSERVATIVE PARTY BACKBENCHERS WERE CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INABILITY TO STOP THE GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT IN BRITAIN'S NORTH . REASON FOR CONFIDENCE . SEEKING A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF JOBS, MACMILLAN LAST WEEK GAVE LORD HAILSHAM A NEW MINISTERIAL TASK OF STUDYING THE NORTHEAST DEPRESSED AREAS, AND TOLD BIRMINGHAM BUSINESSMEN THAT \" WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK \" THE ECONOMIC SLUMP MIGHT BE REVERSED THIS YEAR . AS ANOTHER WEAPON AGAINST POLITICAL DECLINE, MACMILLAN IS CLEARLY COUNTING ON ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING OBSTACLES AHEAD . ON TV HE SAID : \" I BELIEVE THAT AS SOON AS THE COMMON MARKET IS SETTLED, AND AS SOON AS IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT, YOU WILL FIND THE BUSINESSMEN REINVESTING ON A BIGGER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE . THAT IS WHY I AM CONFIDENT ABOUT 1963 . \" A DECISION ON COMMON MARKET ENTRY MAY BE IMMINENT . THIS WEEK BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR EDWARD HEATH RETURNS TO BRUSSELS FOR A CRUCIAL ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE'S SIX THE \" CRUNCH \" TALKS IN WHICH BRITAIN WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO . WHEN LORD SALISBURY RESIGNED AFTER A SEVEN YEAR TERM . DISMANTLE ITS OWN ELABORATE SYSTEM OR PERSUADE THE EUROPEANS TO EASE THEIR TERMS FOR ENTRY . SEEKING SUPPORT . IN PREPARATION FOR THE BRUSSELS MEETING, TED HEATH WENT TO CHEQUERS, MACMILLAN'S MINISTERIAL ESTATE, SPENT HOURS URGING HIS VIEWS ON WEST GERMANY'S VISITING FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER, A CONSIDERABLE SYMPATHIZER . THEN HEATH CROSSED TO THE CONTINENT TO LINE UP ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN'S POSITION . HE TALKED WITH BELGIUM'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HENRI FAYAT, WHO WANTS BRITAIN IN THE COMMON MARKET, AND WITH FRANCE'S FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHO FAITHFULLY ECHOED DE GAULLE'S RELUCTANCE TO LOWER THE BARS FOR BRITAIN . MACMILLAN HIMSELF WILL CONTINUE THE TASK ON HIS FEB . 1 VISIT TO ROME FOR MEETINGS WITH ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER AMINTORE FANFANI, DUE THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON . AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, THE TORIES WON RELIEF OF SORTS FROM THE DRUMFIRE OF CRITICISM AT HOME THROUGH A TRAGIC HAPPENSTANCE IN THE LABOR PARTY . HUGH GAITSKELL, LABOR'S CAPABLE, HARD-WORKING LEADER, WAS RUSHED TO LONDON'S MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA, DOUBLE PLEURISY AND SEVERE PERIOCARDITIS . IN GREAT PAIN AND SCARCELY ABLE TO BREATHE, GAITSKELL WAS ALLOWED NO VISITORS EXCEPT HIS WIFE . SNAP PRESSURE . LABOR SPOKESMEN OFFICIALLY SPREAD THE NEWS THAT GAITSKELL WOULD BE BACK AT WORK WITHIN FIVE TO SIX WEEKS, BUT MEDICAL MEN THOUGHT THREE TO SIX MONTHS MORE LIKELY . THIS MEANS HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEAD LABOR'S ATTACK ON BRITAIN'S COMMON MARKET ENTRY . IN FACT, TO LABOR'S ACUTE EMBARRASSMENT, THE MAN WHO BECOMES SPOKESMAN IN GAITSKELL'S PLACE IS DEPUTY LEADER GEORGE BROWN, WHO IS AS PRO-COMMON MARKET AS GAITSKELL AS ANTI . THE CONSERVATIVE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH PAID TRIBUTE TO GAITSKELL BY SUGGESTING THAT \" WITHOUT HIM, THERE CAN BE NO ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT WORTH THE NAME . \" SOME TORIES PROMPTLY URGED MACMILLAN TO CALL A SNAP GENERAL ELECTION WHILE LABOR IS VIRTUALLY LEADERLESS . BUT MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RESIST THE PRESSURE, SELECT HIS OWN TIME BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER 1964, THE DATE BY WHICH A GENERAL ELECTION MUST BE HELD . IF, DURING THE \" CRUNCH \" OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IN BRUSSELS, BRITAIN IS ADMITTED TO THE COMMON MARKET ON AN APPROXIMATION OF ITS OWN TERMS, AND IF THE STRAITENED ECONOMY REVIVES AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION FOR A GENERAL ELECTION IN THE FALL . MACMILLAN, WHO WILL BE 69 NEXT MONTH, SAID DURING HIS TV INTERVIEW THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD PUT IN ANOTHER SIX YEARS ON THE JOB, AND ADDED JOKINGLY : \" THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PEOPLE COULD STAND ANOTHER SIX . \" THE ANSWER MAY BE LEARNED DURING THE COMING FATEFUL WEEKS IN BRUSSELS .\n",

FISTFIGHTS WERE COMMON IN DOZENS OF OTHER TOWNS AND VILLAGES . THE UGLY VIOLENCE HAS ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR : ALL THE VICTIMS WERE CHINESE, THAT MINORITY OF 3,000,000 AMONG INDONESIA'S 97 MILLION WHICH BY HARD WORK AND NIMBLE BRAIN HAS EXTRACTED WEALTH FROM THE OVERHEATED, FORESTED ARCHIPELAGO OF PRESIDENT SUKARNO . THE RACIAL BITTERNESS BEATS EVEN BIRMINGHAM, FOR DESPITE REPEATED GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO CRACK THEIR ECONOMIC POWER, THE CHINESE SOMETIMES OPERATING THROUGH MIDDLEMEN TO CIRCUMVENT OFFICIAL SANCTIONS STILL CONTROL TRADE, AGRICULTURE, SMALL INDUSTRY, THE BLACK MARKET AND OTHER FORMS OF COMMERCE . \" GO INTO EVEN THE SMALLEST VILLAGE IN INDONESIA, \" AN INDONESIAN ARMY OFFICER ONCE COMPLAINED, \" AND YOU WILL FIND ONE MAN WHOSE HOUSE HAS ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND A REFRIGERATOR . THAT MAN WILL BE CHINESE . \" WE ARE HUNGRY . \" THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN INDONESIA'S PREJUDICE, SINCE THE OVERSEAS CHINESE HAVE BEEN RUNNING THINGS THERE FOR YEARS . BUT FEELING AGAINST THE CHINESE HAS RISEN HIGHER AS INDONESIA HAS SLID TOWARD THE BRINK OF ECONOMIC RUIN . INFLATION IS OUT OF CONTROL ; BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION HAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST YEAR, AND THE U.S . DOLLAR, OFFICIALLY PEGGED AT 45 RUPIAHS, NOW GETS 1,500 RUPIAHS ON THE BLACK MARKET . A GOOD SARONG COSTS A WORKER THREE MONTHS' PAY, AND ONE INDONESIAN AIRLINE PILOT HAS COMPLAINED THAT HE CAN MAKE ENDS MEET ONLY BY SMUGGLING IN CAMERAS FROM HONG KONG . GOVERNMENTSUBSIDIZED SCHOOLBOOKS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SOME STUDENTS . THERE ARE PERIODIC RICE SHORTAGES, AND PRODUCTION OF RUBBER, COPRA, AND TIN ON EXPROPRIATED DUTCH ESTATES HAS DECLINED SHARPLY UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF FUMBLING GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS . STUDENTS HAVE STAGED DEMONSTRATIONS WITH BANNERS SCREAMING : \" WE ARE HUNGRY . \" RESENTMENT AGAINST THE RICH, WELL-FED CHINESE MINORITY FINALLY EXPLODED AFTER A FISTFIGHT BETWEEN AN INDONESIAN STUDENT AND A CHINESE STUDENT AT BANDUNG'S INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY . WHEN A YOUTHFUL RIOTER WAS SHOT BY POLICE IN ONE TOWN, MOBS WITH BAMBOO CLUBS HERDED CHINESE FROM THEIR HOUSES AND MADE THEM BOW THEIR HEADS AS HIS FUNERAL PROCESSION PASSED BY . FIRING OVER THE HEADS OF A SCREAMING THRONG IN BANDUNG, POLICE BROUGHT DOWN A POWER LINE WHICH ELECTROCUTED TWO INDONESIANS . PRONE TO ENJOY . PREDICTABLY, INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT SUKARNO BLAMED NEITHER HIMSELF NOR HIS CHAOTIC ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE RIOTS, SAID THAT THEY WERE CAUSED BY \" COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON THE FOOD AND CLOTHING SITUATION AND ON THE CHINESE MINORITY PROBLEM . \" HE WENT RIGHT AHEAD WITH PLANS TO SQUEEZE OUT WESTERN OIL COMPANIES, THOUGH IN THE PROCESS HE RISKED LOSING THE SOURCE OF ONETHIRD OF HIS NATION'S TOTAL EXPORT EARNINGS . NOT ONE TO BE DISTURBED LONG BY MERE ECONOMIC QUESTIONS, SUKARNO WAS MORE INTERESTED IN TENURE . SO AS TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH ANY FUTURE DISORDERS, HE HAD HIS RUBBER STAMP CONGRESS \" APPOINT \" HIM TO THE PRESIDENCY FOR LIFE . \" THIS DECISION MIGHT NOT ENTIRELY LIVE UP TO CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS, \" HARRUMPHED AN INDONESIAN CABINET MINISTER, \" BUT IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT IT IS A POLITICAL REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCT AND NOT A LEGALISTIC PRODUCT . \" WITH HIS CONTINUED CAREER THUS ASSURED, SUKARNO FLEW OFF FOR WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A LONG REST IN JAPAN, BELGRADE, VIENNA, ROME, AND FRANCE, WHICH HE IS ALWAYS PRONE TO ENJOY . AT SUKARNO'S STOP IN TOKYO LAST WEEK, THE BUSS WAS WAITING AT THE AIRPORT IN THE FORM OF THREE DELECTABLE THINGS OVERDRESSED FOR THE OCCASION .\n",

ONE WOULD NOT STAND BY AND SEE THINGS SMASH . BUT IF YOU ARE ASKING ME WHETHER I WOULD USE FORCE TO KEEP THE TWO RHODESIAS TOGETHER, THE ANSWER IS NO, BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT WORK . \" BY THE TIME WELENSKY CHECKED INTO THE HYDE PARK HOTEL, NATIONALIST KENNETH KAUNDA, TOP AFRICAN LEADER IN NORTHERN RHODESIA, HAD ALREADY ATTENDED HIS FIRST MEETING WITH BRITAIN'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R .

POWER SEEKERS . THIS APPARENTLY WAS ENOUGH FOR RAB BUTLER . HE CALLED IN WELENSKY AND SOUTHERN RHODESIA'S PRIME MINISTER WINSTON FIELD, A LEAN, ENIGMATIC FARMER WHO IS LESS INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF THE FEDERATION THAN IN SEEING TO IT THAT SOUTHERN RHODESIA'S 221,000 WHITES RETAIN POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE STATE'S 3,600,000 BLACKS . BUTLER ANNOUNCED BRITAIN'S DECISION : NO TERRITORY WOULD BE KEPT IN THE FEDERATION AGAINST ITS WILL .
